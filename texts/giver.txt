The Giver 



It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be 
frightened. No. Wrong word, Jonas thought. Frightened meant that 
deep, sickening feeling of something terrible about to happen. 
Frightened was the way he had felt a year ago when an unidentified 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 7 of 182 



aircraft had overflown the community twice. He had seen it both 
times. Squinting toward the sky, he had seen the sleek jet, almost a 
blur at its high speed, go past, and a second later heard the blast of 
sound that followed. Then one more time, a moment later, from the 
opposite direction, the same plane. 

At first, he had been only fascinated. He had never seen aircraft so 
close, for it was against the rules for Pilots to fly over the 
community. Occasionally, when supplies were delivered by cargo 
planes to the landing field across the river, the children rode their 
bicycles to the riverbank and watched, intrigued, the unloading and 
then the takeoff directed to the west, always away from the 
community. 

But the aircraft a year ago had been different. It was not a squat, 
fat-bellied cargo plane but a needle-nosed single-pilot jet. Jonas, 
looking around anxiously, had seen others-adults as well as 
children-stop what they were doing and wait, confused, for an 
explanation of the frightening event. 



Then all of the citizens had been ordered to go into the nearest 
building and stay there. IMMEDIATELY, the rasping voice through 
the speakers had said. LEAVE YOUR BICYCLES WHERE THEY 
ARE. 

Instantly, obediently, Jonas had dropped his bike on its side on the 
path behind his family's dwelling. He had run indoors and stayed 
there, alone. His parents were both at work, and his little sister, Lily, 
was at the Childcare Center where she spent her after-school 
hours. 

Looking through the front window, he had seen no people: none of 
the busy afternoon crew of Street Cleaners, Landscape Workers, 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver

and Food Delivery people who usually populated the community at 
that time of day. He saw only the abandoned bikes here and there 
on their sides; an upturned wheel on one was still revolving slowly. 

He had been frightened then. The sense of his own community 
silent, waiting, had made his stomach churn. He had trembled. 

But it had been nothing. Within minutes the speakers had crackled 
again, and the voice, reassuring now and less urgent, had 
explained that a Pilot-in-Training had misread his navigational 
instructions and made a wrong turn. Desperately the Pilot had been 
trying to make his way back before his error was noticed. 

NEEDLESS TO SAY, HE WILL BE RELEASED, the voice had said, 
followed by silence. There was an ironic tone to that final message, 
as if the Speaker found it amusing; and Jonas had smiled a little, 
though he knew what a grim statement it had been. For a 
contributing citizen to be released from the community was a final 
decision, a terrible punishment, an overwhelming statement of 
failure. 



Even the children were scolded if they used the term lightly at play, 
jeering at a teammate who missed a catch or stumbled in a race. 
Jonas had done it once, had shouted at his best friend, "That's it, 
Asher! You're released!" when Asher's clumsy error had lost a 
match for his team. He had been taken aside for a brief and serious 
talk by the coach, had hung his head with guilt and embarrassment, 
and apologized to Asher after the game. 

Now, thinking about the feeling of fear as he pedaled home along 
the river path, he remembered that moment of palpable, stomach- 
sinking terror when the aircraft had streaked above. It was not what 
he was feeling now with December approaching. He searched for 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 9 of 182 



the right word to describe his own feeling. 

Jonas was careful about language. Not like his friend, Asher, who 
talked too fast and mixed things up, scrambling words and phrases 
until they were barely recognizable and often very funny. 

Jonas grinned, remembering the morning that Asher had dashed 
into the classroom, late as usual, arriving breathlessly in the middle 
of the chanting of the morning anthem. When the class took their 
seats at the conclusion of the patriotic hymn, Asher remained 
standing to make his public apology as was required. 

"I apologize for inconveniencing my learning community." Asher ran 
through the standard apology phrase rapidly, still catching his 
breath. The Instructor and class waited patiently for his explanation. 
The students had all been grinning, because they had listened to 
Asher's explanations so many times before. 

"I left home at the correct time but when I was riding 



along near the hatchery, the crew was separating some salmon. I 
guess I just got distraught, watching them. 

"I apologize to my classmates," Asher concluded. He smoothed his 
rumpled tunic and sat down. 

"We accept your apology, Asher." The class recited the standard 
response in unison. Many of the students were biting their lips to 
keep from laughing. 

"I accept your apology, Asher," the Instructor said. He was smiling. 
"And I thank you, because once again you have provided an 
opportunity for a lesson in language. 'Distraught' is too strong an 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 10 of 182 



adjective to describe salmon-viewing." He turned and wrote 
"distraught" on the instructional board. Beside it he wrote 
"distracted." 

Jonas, nearing his home now, smiled at the recollection. Thinking, 
still, as he wheeled his bike into its narrow port beside the door, he 
realized that frightened was the wrong word to describe his 
feelings, now that December was almost here. It was too strong an 
adjective. 

He had waited a long time for this special December. Now that it 
was almost upon him, he wasn't frightened, but he was ... eager, he 
decided. He was eager for it to come. And he was excited, 
certainly. All of the Elevens were excited about the event that would 
be coming so soon. 

But there was a little shudder of nervousness when he thought 
about it, about what might happen. 

Apprehensive, Jonas decided. That's what I am. 

"Who wants to be the first tonight, for feelings?" Jonas's father 
asked, at the conclusion of their evening meal. 

It was one of the rituals, the evening telling of feelings. 



Sometimes Jonas and his sister, Lily, argued over turns, over who 
would get to go first. Their parents, of course, were part of the 
ritual; they, too, told their feelings each evening. But like all parents- 
-all adults-they didn't fight and wheedle for their turn. 

Nor did Jonas, tonight. His feelings were too complicated this 
evening. He wanted to share them, but he wasn't eager to begin the 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 11 of 182 



process of sifting through his own complicated emotions, even with 
the help that he knew his parents could give. 

"You go, Lily," he said, seeing his sister, who was much younger- 
only a Seven-wiggling with impatience in her chair. 

"I felt very angry this afternoon," Lily announced. "My Childcare 
group was at the play area, and we had a visiting group of Sevens, 
and they didn't obey the rules at all. One of them-a male; I don't 
know his name-kept going right to the front of the line for the slide, 
even though the rest of us were all waiting. I felt so angry at him. I 
made my hand into a fist, like this." She held up a clenched fist and 
the rest of the family smiled at her small defiant gesture. 

"Why do you think the visitors didn't obey the rules?" Mother asked. 

Lily considered, and shook her head. "I don't know. They acted 
like ... like ... " 

"Animals?" Jonas suggested. He laughed. 

"That's right," Lily said, laughing too. "Like animals." Neither child 
knew what the word meant, exactly, but it was often used to 
describe someone uneducated or clumsy, someone who didn't fit 
in. 



"Where were the visitors from?" Father asked. 

Lily frowned, trying to remember. "Our leader told us, when he 
made the welcome speech, but I can't remember. I guess I wasn't 
paying attention. It was from another community. They had to leave 
very early, and they had their midday meal on the bus." 

Mother nodded. "Do you think it's possible that their rules may be 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 12 of 182 



different? And so they simply didn't know what your play area rules 
were?" 

Lily shrugged, and nodded. "I suppose." 

"You've visited other communities, haven't you?" Jonas asked. "My 
group has, often." 

Lily nodded again. "When we were Sixes, we went and shared a 
whole school day with a group of Sixes in their community." 

"How did you feel when you were there?" 

Lily frowned. "I felt strange. Because their methods were different. 
They were learning usages that my group hadn't learned yet, so we 
felt stupid." 

Father was listening with interest. "I'm thinking, Lily," he said, 
"about the boy who didn't obey the rules today. Do you think it's 
possible that he felt strange and stupid, being in a new place with 
rules that he didn't know about?" 

Lily pondered that. "Yes," she said, finally. 

"I feel a little sorry for him," Jonas said, "even though I don't even 
know him. I feel sorry for anyone who is in a place where he feels 
strange and stupid." 

"How do you feel now, Lily?" Father asked. "Still angry?" 

"I guess not," Lily decided. "I guess I feel a little sorry for him. And 
sorry I made a fist." She grinned. 



Jonas smiled back at his sister. Lily's feelings were always 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 13 of 182 



straightforward, fairly simple, usually easy to resolve. .He guessed 
that his own had been, too, when he was a Seven. 

He listened politely, though not very attentively, while his father 
took his turn, describing a feeling of worry that he'd had that day at 
work: a concern about one of the newchildren who wasn't doing 
well. Jonas's father's title was Nurturer. He and the other Nurturers 
were responsible for all the physical and emotional needs of every 
newchild during its earliest life. It was a very important job, Jonas 
knew, but it wasn't one that interested him much. 

"What gender is it?" Lily asked. 

"Male," Father said. "He's a sweet little male with a lovely 
disposition. But he isn't growing as fast as he should, and he 
doesn't sleep soundly. We have him in the extra care section for 
supplementary nurturing, but the committee's beginning to talk 
about releasing him." 

"Oh, no, "Mother murmured sympathetically. "I know how sad that 
must make you feel." 

Jonas and Lily both nodded sympathetically as well. Release of 
newchildren was always sad, because they hadn't had a chance to 
enjoy life within the community yet. And they hadn't done anything 
wrong. 

There were only two occasions of release which were not 
punishment. Release of the elderly, which was a time of celebration 
for a life well and fully lived; and release of a newchild, which 
always brought a sense of what-could-we- have-done. This was 
especially troubling for the Nurturers, like Father, who felt they had 
failed somehow. But it happened very rarely. 

"Well," Father said, "I'm going to keep trying. I may 



file://C :\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 1 0/1 9/20 10 



The Giver 



Page 14 of 182

ask the committee for permission to bring him here at night, if you 
don't mind. You know what the night-crew Nurturers are like. I think 
this little guy needs something extra." 

"Of course," Mother said, and Jonas and Lily nodded. They had 
heard Father complain about the night crew before. It was a lesser 
job, night-crew nurturing, assigned to those who lacked the interest 
or skills or insight for the more vital jobs of the daytime hours. Most 
of the people on the night crew had not even been given spouses 
because they lacked, somehow, the essential capacity to connect 
to others, which was required for the creation of a family unit. 

"Maybe we could even keep him," Lily suggested sweetly, trying to 
look innocent. The .look was fake, Jonas knew; they all knew. 



"Lily," Mother reminded her, smiling, "you know the rules." 

Two children-one male, one female-to each family unit. It was 
written very clearly in the rules. 

Lily giggled. "Well," she said, "I thought maybe just this once." 

Next, Mother, who held a prominent position at the Department of 
Justice, talked about her feelings. Today a repeat offender had 
been brought before her, someone who had broken the rules 
before. Someone who she hoped had been adequately and fairly 
punished, and who had been restored to his place: to his job, his 
home, his family unit. To see him brought before her a second time 
caused her overwhelming feelings of frustration and anger. And 
even 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 15 of 182 



guilt, that she hadn't made a difference in his life. 

"I feel frightened, too, for him," she confessed. "You know that 
there's no third chance. The rules say that if there's a third 
transgression, he simply has to be released." Jonas shivered. He 
knew it happened. There was even a boy in his group of Elevens 
whose father had been released years before. No one ever 
mentioned it; the disgrace was unspeakable. It was hard to 
imagine. 

Lily stood up and went to her mother. She stroked her mother's 
arm. 

From his place at the table, Father reached over and took her hand. 
Jonas reached for the other. 

One by one, they comforted her. Soon she smiled, thanked them, 
and murmured that she felt soothed. 

The ritual continued. "Jonas?" Father asked. "You're last, tonight." 

Jonas sighed. This evening he almost would have preferred to keep 
his feelings hidden. But it was, of course, against the rules. 

"I'm feeling apprehensive," he confessed, glad that the appropriate 
descriptive word had finally come to him. "Why is that, son?" His 
father looked concerned. 

"I know there's really nothing to worry about," Jonas explained, 
"and that every adult has been through it. I know you have, Father, 
and you too, Mother. But it's the Ceremony that I'm apprehensive 
about. It's almost December." 

Lily looked up, her eyes wide. "The Ceremony of Twelve," she 
whispered in an awed voice. Even the smallest children-Lily's age 
and younger-knew that it lay in the future for each of them. 



file://C :\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 1 0/1 9/20 10

"I'm glad you told us of your feelings," Father said. 

"Lily," Mother said, beckoning to the little girl, "Go on now and get 
into your nightclothes. Father and I are going to stay here and talk 
to Jonas for a while." 

Lily sighed, but obediently she got down from her chair. "Privately?" 
she asked. 

Mother nodded. "Yes," she said, "this talk will be a private one with 
Jonas." 



11 



Jonas watched as his father poured a fresh cup of coffee. He 
waited. 

"You know," his father finally said, "every December was exciting to 
me when I was young. And it has been for you and Lily, too, I'm 
sure. Each December brings such changes." 

Jonas nodded. He could remember the Decembers back to when 
he had become, well, probably a Four. The earlier ones were lost to 
him. But he observed them each year, and he remembered Lily's 
earliest Decembers. He remembered when his family received Lily, 
the day she was named, the day that she had become a One. 

The Ceremony for the Ones was always noisy and fun. Each 
December, all the newchildren born in the previous year turned 
One. One at a time-there were always fifty in each year's group, if 
none had been released --they had been brought to the stage by 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 17 of 182 



the Nurturers who had cared for them since birth. Some were 
already walking, wobbly on their unsteady legs; others were no 
more than a few days old, wrapped in blankets, held by their 
Nurturers. 

"I enjoy the Naming," Jonas said. 

His mother agreed, smiling. "The year we got Lily, we 



12 



knew, of course, that we'd receive our female, because we'd made 
our application and been approved. But I'd been wondering and 
wondering what her name would be." 

"I could have sneaked a look at the list prior to the ceremony," 
Father confided. "The committee always makes the list in advance, 
and it's right there in the office at the Nurturing Center. 

"As a matter of fact," he went on, "I feel a little guilty about this. But 
I did go in this afternoon and looked to see if this year's Naming list 
had been made yet. It was right there in the office, and I looked up 
number Thirty-six-that's the little guy I've been concerned about- 
because it occurred to me that it might enhance his nurturing if I 
could call him by a name. Just privately, of course, when no one 
else is around." 

"Did you find it?" Jonas asked. He was fascinated. It didn't seem a 
terribly important rule, but the fact that his father had broken a rule 
at all awed him. He glanced at his mother, the one responsible for 
adherence to the rules, and was relieved that she was smiling. 

His father nodded. "His name-if he makes it to the Naming without 
being released, of course-is to be Gabriel. So I whisper that to him 
when I feed him every four hours, and during exercise and 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml

The Giver Page 18 of 182 



playtime. If no one can hear me. 

"I call him Gabe, actually," he said, and grinned. "Gabe." Jonas 
tried it out. A good name, he decided. Though Jonas had only 
become a Five the year that they acquired Lily and learned her 
name, he remembered the excitement, the conversations at home, 
wondering about her: how she would look, who she would be, how 

13 I 

she would fit into their established family unit. He remembered 
climbing the steps to the stage with his parents, his father by his 
side that year instead of with the Nurturers, since it was the year 
that he would be given a newchild of his own. 

He remembered his mother taking the newchild, his sister, into her 
arms, while the document was read to the assembled family units. 
"Newchild Twenty-three," the Namer had read. "Lily." 

He remembered his father's look of delight, and that his father had 
whispered, "She's one of my favorites. I was hoping for her to be 
the one." The crowd had clapped, and Jonas had grinned. He liked 
his sister's name. Lily, barely awake, had waved her small fist. 
Then they had stepped down to make room for the next family unit. 

"When I was an Eleven," his father said now, "as you are, Jonas, I 
was very impatient, waiting for the Ceremony of Twelve. It's a long 
two days. I remember that I enjoyed the Ones, as I always do, but 
that I didn't pay much attention to the other ceremonies, except for 
my sister's. She became a Nine that year, and got her bicycle. I'd 
been teaching her to ride mine, even though technically I wasn't 
supposed to." 

Jonas laughed. It was one of the few rules that was not taken very 
seriously and was almost always broken. The children all received 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 19 of 182 



their bicycles at Nine; they were not allowed to ride bicycles before 
then. But almost always, the older brothers and sisters had secretly 
taught the younger ones. Jonas had been thinking already about 
teaching Lily. 

There was talk about changing the rule and giving the bicycles at 
an earlier age. A committee was studying 






14 



the idea. When something went to a committee for study, the 
people always joked about it. They said that the committee 
members would become Elders by the time the rule change was 
made. 

Rules were very hard to change. Sometimes, if it was a very 
important rule-unlike the one governing the age for bicycles— it 
would have to go, eventually, to The Receiver for a decision. The 
Receiver was the most important Elder. Jonas had never even 
seen him, that he knew of; someone in a position of such 
importance lived and worked alone. But the committee would never 
bother The Receiver with a question about bicycles; they would 
simply fret and argue about it themselves for years, until the 
citizens forgot that it had ever gone to them for study. 

His father continued. "So I watched and cheered when my sister, 
Katya, became a Nine and removed her hair ribbons and got her 
bicycle," Father went on. "Then I didn't pay much attention to the 
Tens and Elevens. And finally, at the end of the second day, which 
seemed to go on forever, it was my turn. It was the Ceremony of 
Twelve." 

Jonas shivered. He pictured his father, who must have been a shy 
and quiet boy, for he was a shy and quiet man, seated with his 
group, waiting to be called to the stage. The Ceremony of Twelve 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 20 of 182 



was the last of the Ceremonies. The most important. 

"I remember how proud my parents looked--and my sister, too; 
even though she wanted to be out riding the bicycle publicly, she 
stopped fidgeting and was very still and attentive when my turn 
came. 

"But to be honest, Jonas," his father said, "for me there 



15 



was not the element of suspense that there is with your Ceremony. 
Because I was already fairly certain of what my Assignment was to 
be." 

Jonas was surprised. There was no way, really, to know in 
advance. It was a secret selection, made by the leaders of the 
community, the Committee of Elders, who took the responsibility so 
seriously that there were never even any jokes made about 
Assignments. 

His mother seemed surprised, too. "How could you have known?" 
she asked. 

His father smiled his gentle smile. "Well, it was clear to me-and my 
parents later confessed that it had been obvious to them, too-what 
my aptitude was. I had always loved the newchildren more than 
anything. When my friends in my age group were holding bicycle 
races, or building toy vehicles or bridges with their construction 
sets, or- 

"All the things I do with my friends," Jonas pointed out, and his 
mother nodded in agreement. 

"I always participated, of course, because as children we must

Page 21 of 182 



experience all of those things. And I studied hard in school, as you 
do, Jonas. But again and again, during free time, I found myself 
drawn to the newchildren. I spent almost all of my volunteer hours 
helping in the Nurturing Center. Of course the Elders knew that, 
from their observation." 

Jonas nodded. During the past year he had been aware of the 
increasing level of observation. In school, at recreation time, and 
during volunteer hours, he had noticed the Elders watching him and 
the other Elevens. He had seen them taking notes. He knew, too, 
that the Elders were 



16 



meeting for long hours with all of the instructors that he and the 
other Elevens had had during their years of school. 

"So I expected it, and I was pleased, but not at all surprised, when 
my Assignment was announced as Nurturer," Father explained. 

"Did everyone applaud, even though they weren't surprised?" 
Jonas asked. 

"Oh, of course. They were happy for me, that my Assignment was 
what I wanted most. I felt very fortunate." His father smiled. 

"Were any of the Elevens disappointed, your year?" Jonas asked. 
Unlike his father, he had no idea what his Assignment would be. 
But he knew that some would disappoint him. Though he respected 
his father's work, Nurturer would not be his wish. And he didn't envy 
Laborers at all. 

His father thought. "No, I don't think so. Of course the Elders are so 
careful in their observations and selections."

"I think it's probably the most important job in our community," his 
mother commented. 

"My friend Yoshiko was surprised by her selection as Doctor," 
Father said, "but she was thrilled. And let's see, there was Andrei--I 
remember that when we were boys he never wanted to do physical 
things. He spent all the recreation time he could with his 
construction set, and his volunteer hours were always on building 
sites. The Elders knew that, of course. Andrei was given the 
Assignment of Engineer and he was delighted." 

"Andrei later designed the bridge that crosses the river to the west 
of town," Jonas's mother said. "It wasn't there when we were 
children." 



17 



"There are very rarely disappointments, Jonas. I don't think you 
need to worry about that," his father reassured him. "And if there 
are, you know there's an appeal process." But they all laughed at 
that--an appeal went to a committee for study. 

"I worry a little about Asher's Assignment," Jonas confessed. 
"Asher's such fun. But he doesn't really have any serious interests. 
He makes a game out of everything." 

His father chuckled. "You know," he said, "I remember when Asher 
was a newchild at the Nurturing Center, before he was named. He 
never cried. He giggled and laughed at everything. All of us on the 
staff enjoyed nurturing Asher." 

"The Elders know Asher," his mother said. "They'll find exactly the 
right Assignment for him. I don't think you need to worry about him. 
But, Jonas, let me warn you about something that may not have 
occurred to you. I know I didn't think about it until after my 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010

Page 23 of 182 



Ceremony of Twelve." 

"What's that?" 

"Well, it's the last of the Ceremonies, as you know. After Twelve, 
age isn't important. Most of us even lose track of how old we are as 
time passes, though the information is in the Hall of Open Records, 
and we could go and look it up if we wanted to. What's important is 
the preparation for adult life, and the training you'll receive in your 
Assignment." 

"I know that," Jonas said. "Everyone knows that." 

"But it means," his mother went on, "that you'll move into a new 
group. And each of your friends will. You'll no longer be spending 
your time with your group of Elevens. After the Ceremony of 
Twelve, you'll be with your Assignment 



18 



group, with those in training. No more volunteer hours. No more 
recreation hours. So your friends will no longer be as close." 

Jonas shook his head. "Asher and I will always be friends," he said 
firmly. "And there will still be school." 

"That's true," his father agreed. "But what your mother said is true 
as well. There will be changes." 

"Good changes, though," his mother pointed out. "After my 
Ceremony of Twelve, I missed my childhood recreation. But when I 
entered my training for Law and Justice, I found myself with people 
who shared my interests. I made friends on a new level, friends of 
all ages." 

"Did you still play at all, after Twelve?" Jonas asked.

10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 24 of 182 



"Occasionally," his mother replied. "But it didn't seem as important 
to me." 

"I did," his father said, laughing. "I still do. Every day, at the 
Nurturing Center, I play bounce-on-the-knee, and peek-a-boo, and 
hug-the-teddy." He reached over and stroked Jonas's neatly 
trimmed hair. "Fun doesn't end when you become Twelve." 

Lily appeared, wearing her nightclothes, in the doorway. She gave 
an impatient sigh. "This is certainly a very long private 
conversation," she said. "And there are certain people waiting for 
their comfort object." 

"Lily," her mother said fondly, "you're very dose to being an Eight, 
and when you're an Eight, your comfort object will be taken away. It 
will be recycled to the younger children. You should be starting to 
go off to sleep without it." 

But her father had already gone to the shelf and taken down the 
stuffed elephant which was kept there. Many 



19 



of the comfort objects, like Lily's, were soft, stuffed, imaginary 
creatures. Jonas's had been called a bear. 

"Here you are, Lily-billy," he said. "I'll come help you remove your 
hair ribbons." 

Jonas and his mother rolled their eyes, yet they watched 
affectionately as Lily and her father headed to her sleeping-room 
with the stuffed elephant that had been given to her as her comfort 
object when she was born. His mother moved to her big desk and 
opened her briefcase; her work never seemed to end, even when 
she was at home in the evening. Jonas went to his own desk and 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 25 of 182 



began to sort through his school papers for the evening's 
assignment. But his mind was still on December and the coming 
Ceremony. 

Though he had been reassured by the talk with his parents, he 
hadn't the slightest idea what Assignment the Elders would be 
selecting for his future, or how he might feel about it when the day 
came. 



20 



"Oh, look!" Lily squealed in delight. "Isn't he cute? Look how tiny he 
is! And he has funny eyes like yours, Jonas!" Jonas glared at her. 
He didn't like it that she had mentioned his eyes. He waited for his 
father to chastise Lily. But Father was busy unstrapping the 
carrying basket from the back of his bicycle. Jonas walked over to 
look. 

It was the first thing Jonas noticed as he looked at the newchild 
peering up curiously from the basket. The pale eyes. 

Almost every citizen in the community had dark eyes. His parents 
did, and Lily did, and so did all of his group members and friends. 
But there were a few exceptions: Jonas himself, and a female Five 
who he had noticed had the different, lighter eyes. No one 
mentioned such things; it was not a rule, but was considered rude 
to call attention to things that were unsettling or different about 
individuals. Lily, he decided, would have to learn that soon, or she 
would be called in for chastisement because of her insensitive 
chatter. 

Father put his bike into its port. Then he picked up the basket and 
carried it into the house. Lily followed

behind, but she glanced back over her shoulder at Jonas and 
teased, "Maybe he had the same Birthmother as you." 

Jonas shrugged. He followed them inside. But he had been startled 
by the newchild's eyes. Mirrors were rare in the community; they 
weren't forbidden, but there was no real need of them, and Jonas 
had simply never bothered to look at himself very often even when 
he found himself in a location where a mirror existed. Now, seeing 
the newchild and its expression, he was reminded that the light 
eyes were not only a rarity but gave the one who had them a 
certain look-what was it? Depth, he decided; as if one were looking 
into the clear water of the river, down to the bottom, where things 
might lurk which hadn't been discovered yet. He felt self-conscious, 
realizing that he, too, had that look. 

He went to his desk, pretending not to be interested in the 
newchild. On the other side of the room, Mother and Lily were 
bending over to watch as Father unwrapped its blanket. 

"What's his comfort object called?" Lily asked, picking up the 
stuffed creature which had been placed beside the newchild in his 
basket. 

Father glanced at it. "Hippo," he said. 

Lily giggled at the strange word. "Hippo," she repeated, and put the 
comfort object down again. She peered at the unwrapped newchild, 
who waved his arms. 

"I think newchildren are so cute," Lily sighed. "I hope I get assigned 
to be a Birthmother." 

"Lily!" Mother spoke very sharply. "Don't say that. There's very little 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml

Page 27 of 182 



honor in that Assignment." 



"But I was talking to Natasha. You know the Ten who 



22 



lives around the corner? She does some of her volunteer hours at 
the Birthing Center. And she told me that the Birthmothers get 
wonderful food, and they have very gentle exercise periods, and 
most of the time they just play games and amuse themselves while 
they're waiting. 1 think I'd like that," Lily said petulantly. 

"Three years," Mother told her firmly. "Three births and that's all. 
After that they are Laborers for the rest of their adult lives, until the 
day that they enter the House of the Old. Is that what you want, 
Lily? Three lazy years, and then hard physical labor until you are 
old?" 

"Well, no, I guess not," Lily acknowledged reluctantly Father turned 
the newchild onto his tummy in the basket. He sat beside it and 
rubbed its small back with a rhythmic motion. "Anyway, Lily-billy," 
he said affectionately, "the Birthmothers never even get to see 
newchildren. If you enjoy the little ones so much, you should hope 
for an Assignment as Nurturer." 

"When you're an Eight and start your volunteer hour, you can try 
some at the Nurturing Center," Mother suggested. 

"Yes, I think I will," Lily said. She knelt beside the basket. "What did 
you say his name is? Gabriel? Hello, Gabriel," she said in a 
singsong voice. Then she giggled "Ooops," she whispered. "I think 
he's alseep. I guess I'd better be quiet." 

Jonas turned to the school assignments on his desk Some chance 
of that, he thought. Lily was never quiet Probably she should hope 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 28 of 182 



for an Assignment as Speaker so that she could sit in the office with 
the microphone all day, making announcements. He laughed 
silently to himself, picturing his sister droning on in the self- 
important 



23 



voice that all the Speakers seemed to develop, saying things like, 
ATTENTION. THIS IS A REMINDER TO FEMALES UNDER NINE 
THAT HAIR RIBBONS ARE TO BE NEATLY TIED AT ALL TIMES. 

He turned toward Lily and noticed to his satisfaction that her 
ribbons were, as usual, undone and dangling. There would be an 
announcement like that quite soon, he felt certain, and it would be 
directed mainly at Lily, though her name, of course, would not be 
mentioned. Everyone would know. 

Everyone had known, he remembered with humiliation, that the 
announcement ATTENTION. THIS IS A REMINDER TO MALE 
ELEVENS THAT OBJECTS ARE NOT TO BE REMOVED FROM 
THE RECREATION AREA AND THAT SNACKS ARE TO BE 
EATEN, NOT HOARDED had been specifically directed at him, the 
day last month that he had taken an apple home. No one had 
mentioned it, not even his parents, because the public 
announcement had been sufficient to produce the appropriate 
remorse. He had, of course, disposed of the apple and made his 
apology to the Recreation Director the next morning, before school. 

Jonas thought again about that incident. He was still bewildered by 
it. Not by the announcement or the necessary apology; those were 
standard procedures, and he had deserved them-but by the 
incident itself. He probably should have brought up his feeling of 
bewilderment that very evening when the family unit had shared 
their feelings of the day. But he had not been able to sort out and 
put words to the source of his confusion, so he had let it pass. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010

Page 29 of 182 



It had happened during the recreation period, when he had been 
playing with Asher. Jonas had casually picked 



r 



24 



up an apple from the basket where the snacks were kept, and had 
thrown it to his friend. Asher had thrown it back, and they had 
begun a simple game of catch. 

There had been nothing special about it; it was an activity that he 
had performed countless times: throw, catch; throw, catch. It was 
effortless for Jonas, and even boring, though Asher enjoyed it, and 
playing catch was a required activity for Asher because it would 
improve his hand-eye coordination, which was not up to standards. 

But suddenly Jonas had noticed, following the path of the apple 
through the air with his eyes, that the piece of fruit had-well, this 
was the part that he couldn't adequately understand-the apple had 
changed. Just for an instant. It had changed in mid-air, he 
remembered. Then it was in his hand, and he looked at it carefully, 
but it was the same apple. Unchanged. The same size and shape: 
a perfect sphere. The same nondescript shade, about the same 
shade as his own tunic. 

There was absolutely nothing remarkable about that apple. He had 
tossed it back and forth between his hands a few times, then 
thrown it again to Asher. And again~in the air, for an instant only-it 
had changed. 

It had happened four times. Jonas had blinked, looked around, and 
then tested his eyesight, squinting at the small print on the 
identification badge attached to his tunic. He read his name quite 
clearly. He could also clearly see Asher at the other end of the 
throwing area. And he had had no problem catching the apple. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 30 of 182 



Jonas had been completely mystified. 

"Ash?" he had called. "Does anything seem strange to you? About 
the apple?" 

"Yes," Asher called back, laughing. "It jumps out of 



25 



my hand onto the ground!" Asher had just dropped it once again. 

So Jonas laughed too, and with his laughter tried to ignore his 
uneasy conviction that something had happened. But he had taken 
the apple home, against the recreation area rules. That evening, 
before his parents and Lily arrived at the dwelling, he had held it in 
his hands and looked at it carefully. It was slightly bruised now, 
because Asher had dropped it several times. But there was nothing 
at all unusual about the apple. 

He had held a magnifying glass to it. He had tossed it several times 
across the room, watching, and then rolled it around and around on 
his desktop, waiting for the thing to happen again. 

But it hadn't. The only thing that happened was the announcement 
later that evening over the speaker, the announcement that had 
singled him out without using his name, that had caused both of his 
parents to glance meaningfully at his desk where the apple still lay. 

Now, sitting at his desk, staring at his schoolwork as his family 
hovered over the newchild in its basket, he shook his head, trying 
to forget the odd incident. He forced himself to arrange his papers 
and try to study a little before the evening meal. The newchild, 
Gabriel, stirred and whimpered, and Father spoke softly to Lily, 
explaining the feeding procedure as he opened the container that 
held the formula and equipment. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 31 of 182 



The evening proceeded as all evenings did in the family unit, in the 
dwelling, in the community: quiet, reflective, a time for renewal and 
preparation for the day to come. It was different only in the addition 
to it of the newchild with his pale, solemn, knowing eyes. 



26 



Jonas rode at a leisurely pace, glancing at the bikeports beside the 
buildings to see if he could spot Asher's. He didn't often do his 
volunteer hours with his friend because Asher frequently fooled 
around and made serious work a little difficult. But now, with Twelve 
coming so soon and the volunteer hours ending, it didn't seem to 
matter. 

The freedom to choose where to spend those hours had always 
seemed a wonderful luxury to Jonas; other hours of the day were 
so carefully regulated. 

He remembered when he had become an Eight, as Lily would do 
shortly, and had been faced with that freedom of choice. The Eights 
always set out on their first volunteer hour a little nervously, giggling 
and staying in groups of friends. They almost invariably did their 
hours on Recreation Duty first, helping with the younger ones in a 
place where they still felt comfortable. But with guidance, as they 
developed self-confidence and maturity, they moved on to other 
jobs, gravitating toward those that would suit their own interests 
and skills. 

A male Eleven named Benjamin had done his entire nearly-Four 
years in the Rehabilitation Center, working with citizens who had 
been injured. It was rumored that he was as skilled now as the 
Rehabilitation Directors 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 32 of 182 



27 



themselves, and that he had even developed some machines and 
methods to hasten rehabilitation. There was no doubt that Benjamin 
would receive his Assignment to that field and would probably be 
permitted to bypass most of the training. 

Jonas was impressed by the things Benjamin had achieved. He 
knew him, of course, since they had always been groupmates, but 
they had never talked about the boy's accomplishments because 
such a conversation would have been awkward for Benjamin. 
There was never any comfortable way to mention or discuss one's 
successes without breaking the rule against bragging, even if one 
didn't mean to. It was a minor rule, rather like rudeness, punishable 
only by gentle chastisement. But still. Better to steer clear of an 
occasion governed by a rule which would be so easy to break. 

The area of dwellings behind him, Jonas rode past the community 
structures, hoping to spot Asher's bicycle parked beside one of the 
small factories or office buildings. He passed the Childcare Center 
where Lily stayed after school, and the play areas surrounding it. 
He rode through the Central Plaza and the large Auditorium where 
public meetings were held. 

Jonas slowed and looked at the nametags on the bicycles lined up 
outside the Nurturing Center. Then he checked those outside Food 
Distribution; it was always fun to help with the deliveries, and he 
hoped he would find his friend there so that they could go together 
on the daily rounds, carrying the cartons of supplies into the 
dwellings of the community. But he finally found Asher's bicycle- 
leaning, as usual, instead of upright in its port, as it should have 
been-at the House of the Old. 



28 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 33 of 182 



There was only one other child's bicycle there, that of a female 
Eleven named Fiona. Jonas liked Fiona. She was a good student, 
quiet and polite, but she had a sense of fun as well, and it didn't 
surprise him that she was working with Asher today. He parked his 
bicycle neatly in the port beside theirs and entered the building. 

"Hello, Jonas," the attendant at the front desk said. She handed him 
the sign-up sheet and stamped her own official seal beside his 
signature. All of his volunteer hours would be carefully tabulated at 
the Hall of Open Records. Once, long ago, it was whispered among 
the children, an Eleven had arrived at the Ceremony of Twelve only 
to hear a public announcement that he had not completed the 
required number of volunteer hours and would not, therefore, be 
given his Assignment. He had been permitted an additional month 
in which to complete the hours, and then given his Assignment 
privately, with no applause, no celebration: a disgrace that had 
clouded his entire future. 

"It's good to have some volunteers here today," the attendant told 
him. "We celebrated a release this morning, and that always throws 
the schedule off a little, so things get backed up." She looked at a 
printed sheet. "Let's see. Asher and Fiona are helping in the 
bathing room. Why don't you join them there? You know where it is, 
don't you?" 

Jonas nodded, thanked her, and walked down the long hallway. He 
glanced into the rooms on either side. The Old were sitting quietly, 
some visiting and talking with one another, others doing handwork 
and simple crafts. A few were asleep. Each room was comfortably 
furnished, the floors covered with thick carpeting. It was a serene 
and 



29 



slow-paced place, unlike the busy centers of manufacture and 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 34 of 182 



distribution where the daily work of the community occurred. 

Jonas was glad that he had, over the years, chosen to do his hours 
in a variety of places so that he could experience the differences. 
He realized, though, that not focusing on one area meant he was 
left with not the slightest idea-not even a guess of what his 
Assignment would be. 

He laughed softly. Thinking about the Ceremony again, Jonas? he 
teased himself. But he suspected that with the date so near, 
probably all of his friends were, too. 

He passed a Caretaker walking slowly with one of the Old in the 
hall. "Hello, Jonas," the young uniformed man said, smiling 
pleasantly. The woman beside him, whose arm he held, was 
hunched over as she shuffled along in her soft slippers. She looked 
toward Jonas and smiled, but her dark eyes were clouded and 
blank. He realized she was blind. 

He entered the bathing room with its warm moist air and scent of 
cleansing lotions. He removed his tunic, hung it carefully on a wall 
hook, and put on the volunteer's smock that was folded on a shelf. 

"Hi, Jonas!" Asher called from the corner where he was kneeling 
beside a tub. Jonas saw Fiona nearby, at a different tub. She 
looked up and smiled at him, but she was busy, gently washing a 
man who lay in the warm water. 

Jonas greeted them and the caretaking attendants at work nearby. 
Then he went to the row of padded lounging chairs where others of 
the Old were waiting. He had worked here before; he knew what to 
do. 

"Your turn, Larissa," he said, reading the nametag on 



file://C :\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 1 0/1 9/20 10 



The Giver 



Page 35 of 182

the woman's robe. "I'll just start the water and then help you up." He 
pressed the button on a nearby empty tub and watched as the 
warm water flowed in through the many small openings on the 
sides. The tub would be filled in a minute and the water flow would 
stop automatically. 

He helped the woman from the chair, led her to the tub, removed 
her robe, and steadied her with his hand on her arm as she 
stepped in and lowered herself. She leaned back and sighed with 
pleasure, her head on a soft cushioned headrest. 

"Comfortable?" he asked, and she nodded, her eyes closed. Jonas 
squeezed cleansing lotion onto the clean sponge at the edge of the 
tub and began to wash her frail body. 

Last night he had watched as his father bathed the newchild. This 
was much the same: the fragile skin, the soothing water, the gentle 
motion of his hand, slippery with soap. The relaxed, peaceful smile 
on the woman's face reminded him of Gabriel being bathed. 

And the nakedness, too. It was against the rules for children or 
adults to look at another's nakedness; but the rule did not apply to 
newchildren or the Old. Jonas was glad. It was a nuisance to keep 
oneself covered while changing for games, and the required 
apology if one had by mistake glimpsed another's body was always 
awkward. He couldn't see why it was necessary. He liked the 
feeling of safety here in this warm and quiet room; he liked the 
expression of trust on the woman's face as she lay in the water 
unprotected, exposed, and free. 

From the corner of his eye he could see his friend Fiona

The Giver Page 36 of 182 



help the old man from the tub and tenderly pat his thin, naked body 
dry with an absorbant cloth. She helped him into his robe. 

Jonas thought Larissa had drifted into sleep, as the Old often did, 
and he was careful to keep his motions steady and gentle so he 
wouldn't wake her. He was surprised when she spoke, her eyes still 
closed. 

"This morning we celebrated the release of Roberto," she told him. 
"It was wonderful." 

"I knew Roberto!" Jonas said. "I helped with his feeding the last 
time I was here, just a few weeks ago. He was a very interesting 
man." 

Larissa opened her eyes happily. "They told his whole life before 
they released him," she said. "They always do. But to be honest," 
she whispered with a mischievous look, "some of the tellings are a 
little boring. I've even seen some of the Old fall asleep during 
tellings- when they released Edna recently. Did you know Edna?" 

Jonas shook his head. He couldn't recall anyone named Edna. 

"Well, they tried to make her life sound meaningful. And of course," 
she added primly, "all lives are meaningful, I don't mean that they 
aren't. But Edna. My goodness. She was a Birthmother, and then 
she worked in Food Production for years, until she came here. She 
never even had a family unit." 

Larissa lifted her head and looked around to make sure no one else 
was listening. Then she confided, "I don't think Edna was very 
smart." 

Jonas laughed. He rinsed her left arm, laid it back into the water, 
and began to wash her feet. She murmured 



file://C :\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 1 0/1 9/20 10 



The Giver 



Page 37 of 182

with pleasure as he massaged her feet with the sponge. 

"But Roberto's life was wonderful," Larissa went on, after a 
moment. "He had been an Instructor of Elevens --you know how 
important that is--and he'd been on the Planning Committee. And- 
goodness, I don't know how he found the time-he also raised two 
very successful children,, and he was also the one who did the 
landscaping design for the Central Plaza. He didn't do the actual 
labor, of course." 

"Now your back. Lean forward and I'll help you sit up." Jonas put 
his arm around her and supported her as she sat. He squeezed the 
sponge against her back and began to rub her sharp-boned 
shoulders. "Tell me about the celebration." 

"Well, there was the telling of his life. That is always first. Then the 
toast. We all raised our glasses and cheered. We chanted the 
anthem. He made a lovely goodbye speech. And several of us 
made little speeches wishing him well. I didn't, though. I've never 
been fond of public speaking. 

"He was thrilled. You should have seen the look on his face when 
they let him go." 

Jonas slowed the strokes of his hand on her back thoughtfully. 
"Larissa," he asked, "what happens when they make the actual 
release? Where exactly did Roberto go?" 

She lifted her bare wet shoulders in a small shrug. "I don't know. I 
don't think anybody does, except the committee. .He just bowed to 
all of us and then walked, like they all do, through the special door 
in the Releasing Room. But you should have seen his look. Pure 
happiness, I'd call it."

Jonas grinned. "I wish I'd been there to see it." 

Larissa frowned. "I don't know why they don't let children come. Not 
enough room, I guess. They should enlarge the Releasing Room." 



"We'll have to suggest that to the committee. Maybe they'd study it," 
Jonas said slyly, and Larissa chortled with laughter. 

"Right.!" she hooted, and Jonas helped her from the tub. 



34 



Usually, at the morning ritual when the family members told their 
dreams, Jonas didn't contribute much. He rarely dreamed. 
Sometimes he awoke with a feeling of fragments afloat in his sleep, 
but he couldn't seem to grasp them and put them together into 
something worthy of telling at the ritual. 

But this morning was different. He had dreamed very vividly the 
night before. 

His mind wandered while Lily, as usual, recounted a lengthy dream, 
this one a frightening one in which she had, against the rules, been 
riding her mother's bicycle and been caught by the Security 
Guards. 

They all listened carefully and discussed with Lily the warning that 
the dream had given. 

"Thank you for your dream, Lily." Jonas said the standard phrase 
automatically, and tried to pay better attention while his mother told 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 39 of 182 



of a dream fragment, a disquieting scene where she had been 
chastised for a rule infraction she didn't understand. Together they 
agreed that it probably resulted from her feelings when she had 
reluctantly dealt punishment to the citizen who had broken the 
major rules a second time. 



35 



Father said that he had had no dreams. 

"Gabe?" Father asked, looking down at the basket where the 
newchild lay gurgling after his feeding, ready to be taken back to 
the Nurturing Center for the day. 

They all laughed. Dream-telling began with Threes. If newchildren 
dreamed, no one knew. 

"Jonas?" Mother asked. They always asked, though they knew how 
rarely Jonas had a dream to tell. 

"I did dream last night," Jonas told them. He shifted in his chair, 
frowning. 

"Good," Father said. "Tell us." 

"The details aren't clear, really," Jonas explained, trying to recreate 
the odd dream in his mind. "I think I was in the bathing room at the 
House of the Old." 

"That's where you were yesterday," Father pointed out. 

Jonas nodded. "But it wasn't really the same. There was a tub, in 
the dream. But only one. And the real bathing room has rows and 
rows of them. But the room in the dream was warm and damp. And 
I had taken off my tunic, but hadn't put on the smock, so my chest 
was bare. I was perspiring, because it was so warm. And Fiona 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml

Page 40 of 182 



was there, the way she was yesterday." 

"Asher, too?" Mother asked. 

Jonas shook his head. "No. It was only me and Fiona, alone in the 
room, standing beside the tub. She was laughing. But I wasn't. I 
was almost a little angry at her, in the dream, because she wasn't 
taking me seriously." 

"Seriously about what?" Lily asked. 

Jonas looked at his plate. For some reason that he didn't 
understand, he felt slightly embarrassed. "I think I 



36 



was trying to convince her that she should get into the tub of water." 

He paused. He knew he had to tell it all, that it was not only all right 
but necessary to tell all of a dream. So he forced himself to relate 
the part that made him uneasy. 

"I wanted her to take off her clothes and get into the tub," he 
explained quickly. "I wanted to bathe her. I had the sponge in my 
hand. But she wouldn't. She kept laughing and saying no." 

He looked up at his parents. "That's all," he said. 

"Can you describe the strongest feeling in your dream, son?" 
Father asked. 

Jonas thought about it. The details were murky and vague. But the 
feelings were clear, and flooded him again now as he thought. "The 
wanting, " he said. "I knew that she wouldn't. And I think I knew that 
she shouldn't. But I wanted it so terribly. I could feel the wanting all 
through me."

"Thank you for your dream, Jonas," Mother said after a moment. 
She glanced at Father. 

"Lily," Father said, "it's time to leave for school. Would you walk 
beside me this morning and keep an eye on the newchild's basket? 
We want to be certain he doesn't wiggle himself loose." 

Jonas began to rise to collect his schoolbooks. He thought it 
surprising that they hadn't talked about his dream at length before 
the thank you. Perhaps they found it as confusing as he had. 

"Wait, Jonas," Mother said gently. "I'll write an apology to your 
instructor so that you won't have to speak one for being late." 



37 



He sank back down into his chair, puzzled. He waved to Father and 
Lily as they left the dwelling, carrying Gabe in his basket. He 
watched while Mother tidied the remains of the morning meal and 
placed the tray by the front door for the Collection Crew. 

Finally she sat down beside him at the table. "Jonas," she said with 
a smile, "the feeling you described as the wanting? It was your first 
Stirrings. Father and I have been expecting it to happen to you. It 
happens to everyone. It happened to Father when he was your 
age. And it happened to me. It will happen someday to Lily. 

"And very often," Mother added, "it begins with a dream." 

Stirrings. He had heard the word before. He remembered that there 
was a reference to the Stirrings in the Book of Rules, though he 
didn't remember what it said. And now and then the Speaker 
mentioned it. ATTENTION. A REMINDER THAT STIRRINGS 
MUST BE REPORTED IN ORDER FOR TREATMENT TO TAKE 
PLACE. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 42 of 182 



He had always ignored that announcement because he didn't 
understand it and it had never seemed to apply to him in any way. 
He ignored, as most citizens did, many of the commands and 
reminders read by the Speaker. 

"Do I have to report it?" he asked his mother. 

She laughed. "You did, in the dream-telling. That's enough." 

"But what about the treatment? The Speaker says that treatment 
must take place." Jonas felt miserable. Just when the Ceremony 
was about to happen, his Ceremony of Twelve, would he have to 
go away someplace for treatment? Just because of a stupid 
dream? 



38 



But his mother laughed again in a reassuring, affectionate way. 
"No, no," she said. "It's just the pills. You're ready for the pills, that's 
all. That's the treatment for Stirrings." 

Jonas brightened. He knew about the pills. His parents both took 
them each morning. And some of his friends did, he knew. Once he 
had been heading off to school with Asher, both of them on their 
bikes, when Asher's father had called from their dwelling doorway, 
"You forgot your pill, Asher!" Asher had groaned good-naturedly, 
turned his bike, and ridden back while Jonas waited. 

It was the sort of thing one didn't ask a friend about because it 
might have fallen into that uncomfortable category of "being 
different." Asher took a pill each morning; Jonas did not. Always 
better, less rude, to talk about things that were the same. 

Now he swallowed the small pill that his mother handed him. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 43 of 182 



"That's all?" he asked. 

"That's all," she replied, returning the bottle to the cupboard. "But 
you mustn't forget. I'll remind you for the first weeks, but then you 
must do it on your own. If you forget, the Stirrings will come back. 
The dreams of Stirrings will come back. Sometimes the dosage 
must be adjusted." 

"Asher takes them," Jonas confided. 

His mother nodded, unsurprised. "Many of your groupmates 
probably do. The males, at least. And they all will, soon. Females 
too." 

"How long will I have to take them?" 

"Until you enter the House of the Old," she explained. 



39 



"All of your adult life. But it becomes routine; after a while you won't 
even pay much attention to it." 

She looked at her watch. "If you leave right now, you won't even be 
late for school. Hurry along. 

"And thank you again, Jonas," she added, as he went to the door, 
"for your dream." 

Pedaling rapidly down the path, Jonas felt oddly proud to have 
joined those who took the pills. For a moment, though, he 
remembered the dream again. The dream had felt pleasurable. 
Though the feelings were confused, he thought that he had liked 
the feelings that his mother had called Stirrings. He remembered 
that upon waking, he had wanted to feel the Stirrings again. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 44 of 182 



Then, in the same way that his own dwelling slipped away behind 
him as he rounded a corner on his bicycle, the dream slipped away 
from his thoughts. Very briefly, a little guiltily, he tried to grasp it 
back. But the feelings had disappeared. The Stirrings were gone. 



40 



"Lily, please hold still," Mother said again.. 

Lily, standing in front of her, fidgeted impatiently. "I can tie them 
myself," she complained. "I always have." 

"I know that," Mother replied, straightening the hair ribbons on the 
little girl's braids. "But I also know that they constantly come loose 
and more often than not, they're dangling down your back by 
afternoon. Today, at least, we want them to be neatly tied and to 
stay neatly tied." 

"I don't like hair ribbons. I'm glad I only have to wear them one 
more year," Lily said irritably. "Next year I get my bicycle, too," she 
added more cheerfully. 

"There are good things each year," Jonas reminded her. "This year 
you get to start your volunteer hours. And remember last year, 
when you became a Seven, you were so happy to get your front- 
buttoned jacket?" 

The little girl nodded and looked down at herself, at the jacket with 
its row of large buttons that designated her as a Seven. Fours, 
Fives, and Sixes all wore jackets that fastened down the back so 
that they would have to help each other dress and would learn 
interdependence. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 45 of 182 



The front-buttoned jacket was the first sign of 



41 



independence, the first very visible symbol of growing up. The 
bicycle, at Nine, would be the powerful emblem of moving gradually 
out into the community, away from the protective family unit. 

Lily grinned and wriggled away from her mother. "And this year you 
get your Assignment," she said to Jonas in an excited voice. "I hope 
you get Pilot. And that you take me flying!" 

"Sure I will," said Jonas. "And I'll get a special little parachute that 
just fits you, and I'll take you up to, oh, maybe twenty thousand feet, 
and open the door, and--" 

"Jonas, " Mother warned. 

"I was only joking," Jonas groaned. "I don't want Pilot, anyway. If I 
get Pilot I'll put in an appeal." 

"Come on," Mother said. She gave Lily's ribbons a final tug. 
"Jonas? Are you ready? Did you take your pill? I want to get a good 
seat in the Auditorium." She prodded Lily to the front door and 
Jonas followed. 

It was a short ride to the Auditorium, Lily waving to her friends from 
her seat on the back of Mother's bicycle. Jonas stowed his bicycle 
beside Mother's and made his way through the throng to find his 
group. 

The entire community attended the Ceremony each year. For the 
parents, it meant two days holiday from work; they sat together in 
the huge hall. Children sat with their groups until they went, one by 
one, to the stage. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 46 of 182 



Father, though, would not join Mother in the audience right away. 
For the earliest ceremony, the Naming, the Nurturers brought the 
newchildren to the stage. Jonas, from his place in the balcony with 
the Elevens, searched the Auditorium for a glimpse of Father. It 
wasn't at all 



42 



hard to spot the Nurturers' section at the front; coming from it were 
the wails and howls of the newchildren who sat squirming on the 
Nurturers' laps. At every other public ceremony, the audience was 
silent and attentive. But once a year, they all smiled indulgently at 
the commotion from the little ones waiting to receive their names 
and families. 

Jonas finally caught his father's eye and waved. Father grinned and 
waved back, then held up the hand of the newchild on his lap, 
making it wave, too. 

It wasn't Gabriel. Gabe was back at the Nurturing Center today, 
being cared for by the night crew. He had been given an unusual 
and special reprieve from the committee, and granted an additional 
year of nurturing before his Naming and Placement. Father had 
gone before the committee with a plea on behalf of Gabriel, who 
had not yet gained the weight appropriate to his days of life nor 
begun to sleep soundly enough at night to be placed with his family 
unit. Normally such a newchild would be labeled Inadequate and 
released from the community. 

Instead, as a result of Father's plea, Gabriel had been labeled 
Uncertain and given the additional year. He would continue to be 
nurtured at the Center and would spend his nights with Jonas's 
family unit. Each family member, including Lily, had been required 
to sign a pledge that they would not become attached to this little 
temporary guest, and that they would relinquish him without protest 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 47 of 182 



or appeal when he was assigned to his own family unit at next 
year's Ceremony. 

At least, Jonas thought, after Gabriel was placed next year, they 
would still see him often because he would be 



43 



part of the community. If he were released, they would not see him 
again. Ever. Those who were released-even as newchildren-were 
sent Elsewhere and never returned to the community. 

Father had not had to release a single newchild this year, so 
Gabriel would have represented a real failure and sadness. Even 
Jonas, though he didn't hover over the little one the way Lily and his 
father did, was glad that Gabe had not been released. 

The first Ceremony began right on time, and Jonas watched as one 
after another each newchild was given a name and handed by the 
Nurturers to its new family unit. For some, it was a first child. But 
many came to the stage accompanied by another child beaming 
with pride to receive a little brother or sister, the way Jonas had 
when he was about to be a Five. 

Asher poked Jonas's arm. "Remember when we got Phillipa?" he 
asked in a loud whisper. Jonas nodded. It had only been last year. 
Asher's parents had waited quite a long time before applying for a 
second child. Maybe, Jonas suspected, they had been so 
exhausted by Asher's lively foolishness that they had needed a little 
time. 

Two of their group, Fiona and another female named Thea, were 
missing temporarily, waiting with their parents to receive 
newchildren. But it was rare that there was such an age gap 
between children in a family unit. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 48 of 182 



When her family's ceremony was completed, Fiona took the seat 
that had been saved for her in the row ahead of Asher and Jonas. 
She turned and whispered to them, "He's cute. But I don't like his 
name very much." She made a face and giggled. Fiona's new 
brother had been 



44 



named Bruno. It wasn't a great name, Jonas thought, like-well, like 
Gabriel, for example. But it was okay. 

The audience applause, which was enthusiastic at each Naming, 
rose in an exuberant swell when one parental pair, glowing with 
pride, took a male newchild and heard him named Caleb. 

This new Caleb was a replacement child. The couple had lost their 
first Caleb, a cheerful little Four. Loss of a child was very, very rare. 
The community was extraordinarily safe, each citizen watchful and 
protective of all children. But somehow the first little Caleb had 
wandered away unnoticed, and had fallen into the river. The entire 
community had performed the Ceremony of Loss together, 
murmuring the name Caleb throughout an entire day, less and less 
frequently, softer in volume, as the long and somber day went on, 
so that the little Four seemed to fade away gradually from 
everyone's consciousness. 

Now, at this special Naming, the community performed the brief 
Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony, repeating the name for the first 
time since the loss: softly and slowly at first, then faster and with 
greater volume, as the couple stood on the stage with the newchild 
sleeping in the mother's arms. It was as if the first Caleb were 
returning. 

Another newchild was given the name Roberto, and Jonas 
remembered that Roberto the Old had been released only last 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 49 of 182 



week. But there was no Murmur-of-Replacement Ceremony for the 
new little Roberto. Release was not the same as Loss. 

He sat politely through the ceremonies of Two and Three and Four, 
increasingly bored as he was each year. Then a break for midday 
meal-served outdoors--and 



45 



back again to the seats, for the Fives, Sixes, Sevens, and finally, 
last of the first day's ceremonies, the Eights. 

Jonas watched and cheered as Lily marched proudly to the stage, 
became an Eight and received the identifying jacket that she would 
wear this year, this one with smaller buttons and, for the first time, 
pockets, indicating that she was mature enough now to keep track 
of her own small belongings. She stood solemnly listening to the 
speech of firm instructions on the responsibilities of Eight and doing 
volunteer hours for the first time. But Jonas could see that Lily, 
though she seemed attentive, was looking longingly at the row of 
gleaming bicycles, which would be presented tomorrow morning to 
the Nines. 

Next year, Lily-billy, Jonas thought. 

It was an exhausting day, and even Gabriel, retrieved in his basket 
from the Nurturing Center, slept soundly that night. 

Finally it was the morning of the Ceremony of Twelve. 

Now Father sat beside Mother in the audience. Jonas could see 
them applauding dutifully as the Nines, one by one, wheeled their 
new bicycles, each with its gleaming nametag attached to the back, 
from the stage. He knew that his parents cringed a little, as he did, 
when Fritz, who lived in the dwelling next door to theirs, received 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 50 of 182 



his bike and almost immediately bumped into the podium with it. 
Fritz was a very awkward child who had been summoned for 
chastisement again and again. His transgressions were small ones, 
always: shoes on the wrong feet, schoolwork misplaced, failure to 
study adequately for a quiz. But each such error reflected 
negatively on his parents' guidance and 



46 



infringed on the community's sense of order and success. Jonas 
and his family had not been looking forward to Fritz's bicycle, which 
they realized would probably too often be dropped on the front walk 
instead of wheeled neatly into its port. 

Finally the Nines were all resettled in their seats, each having 
wheeled a bicycle outside where it would be waiting for its owner at 
the end of the day. Everyone always chuckled and made small 
jokes when the Nines rode home for the first time. "Want me to 
show you how to ride?" older friends would call. "I know you've 
never been on a bike before!" But invariably the grinning Nines, 
who in technical violation of the rule had been practicing secretly for 
weeks, would mount and ride off in perfect balance, training wheels 
never touching the ground. 

Then the Tens. Jonas never found the Ceremony of Ten 
particularly interesting- only time-consuming, as each child's hair 
was snipped neatly into its distinguishing cut: females lost their 
braids at Ten, and males, too, relinquished their long childish hair 
and took on the more manly short style which exposed their ears. 

Laborers moved quickly to the stage with brooms and swept away 
the mounds of discarded hair. Jonas could see the parents of the 
new Tens stir and murmur, and he knew that this evening, in many 
dwellings, they would be snipping and straightening the hastily 
done haircuts, trimming them into a neater line. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 51 of 182 



Elevens. It seemed a short time ago that Jonas had undergone the 
Ceremony of Eleven, but he remembered that it was not one of the 
more interesting ones. By Eleven, one was only waiting to be 
Twelve. It was simply a marking of 



47 



time with no meaningful changes. There was new clothing: different 
undergarments for the females, whose bodies were beginning to 
change; and longer trousers for the males, with a specially shaped 
pocket for the small calculator that they would use this year in 
school; but those were simply presented in wrapped packages 
without an accompanying speech. 

Break for midday meal. Jonas realized he was hungry. He and his 
groupmates congregated by the tables in front of the Auditorium 
and took their packaged food. Yesterday there had been merriment 
at lunch, a lot of teasing and energy. But today the group stood 
anxiously, separate from the other children. Jonas watched the new 
Nines gravitate toward their waiting bicycles, each one admiring his 
or her nametag. He saw the Tens stroking their new shortened hair, 
the females shaking their heads to feel the unaccustomed lightness 
without the heavy braids they had worn so long. 

"I heard about a guy who was absolutely certain he was going to be 
assigned Engineer," Asher muttered as they ate, "and instead they 
gave him Sanitation Laborer. He went out the next day, jumped into 
the river, swam across, and joined the next community he came to. 
Nobody ever saw him again." 

Jonas laughed. "Somebody made that story up, Ash," he said. "My 
father said he heard that story when he was a Twelve." 

But Asher wasn't reassured. He was eyeing the river where it was 
visible behind the Auditorium. "I can't even swim very well," he said. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 52 of 182 



"My swimming instructor said that I don't have the right boyishness 
or something." 



48 



"Buoyancy," Jonas corrected him. 

"Whatever. I don't have it. I sink." 

"Anyway," Jonas pointed out, "have you ever once known of 
anyone-l mean really known for sure, Asher, not just heard a story 
about it-who joined another community?" 

"No," Asher admitted reluctantly. "But you can. It says so in the 
rules. If you don't fit in, you can apply for Elsewhere and be 
released. My mother says that once, about ten years ago, someone 
applied and was gone the next day." Then he chuckled. "She told 
me that because I was driving her crazy. She threatened to apply 
for Elsewhere." 

"She was joking." 

"I know. But it was true, what she said, that someone did that once. 
She said that it was really true. Here today and gone tomorrow. 
Never seen again. Not even a Ceremony of Release." 

Jonas shrugged. It didn't worry him. How could someone not fit in? 
The community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so 
carefully made. 

Even the Matching of Spouses was given such weighty 
consideration that sometimes an adult who applied to receive a 
spouse waited months or even years before a Match was approved 
and announced. All of the factors-disposition, energy level, 
intelligence, and interests-had to correspond and to interact 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 53 of 182 



perfectly. Jonas's mother, for example, had higher intelligence than 
his father; but his father had a calmer disposition. They balanced 
each other. Their Match, which like all Matches had been monitored 
by the Committee of Elders for three years before they 



49 



could apply for children, had always been a successful one. 

Like the Matching of Spouses and the Naming and Placement of 
newchildren, the Assignments were scrupulously thought through 
by the Committee of Elders. 

He was certain that his Assignment, whatever it was to be, and 
Asher's too, would be the right one for them. He only wished that 
the midday break would conclude, that the audience would reenter 
the Auditorium, and the suspense would end. 

As if in answer to his unspoken wish, the signal came and the 
crowd began to move toward the doors. 



50 



Now Jonas's group had taken a new place in the Auditorium, 
trading with the new Elevens, so that they sat in the very front, 
immediately before the stage. 

They were arranged by their original numbers, the numbers they 
had been given at birth. The numbers were rarely used after the 
Naming. But each child knew his number, of course. Sometimes 
parents used them in irritation at a child's misbehavior, indicating 
that mischief made one unworthy of a name. Jonas always 
chuckled when he heard a parent, exasperated, call sharply to a 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 54 of 182 



whining toddler, "That's enough, Twenty-three!" 

Jonas was Nineteen. He had been the nineteenth newchild born his 
year. It had meant that at his Naming, he had been already 
standing and bright-eyed, soon to walk and talk. It had given him a 
slight advantage the first year or two, a little more maturity than 
many of his groupmates who had been born in the later months of 
that year. But it evened out, as it always did, by Three. 

After Three, the children progressed at much the same level, 
though by their first number one could always tell who was a few 
months older than others in his group. Technically, Jonas's full 
number was Eleven-nineteen, 



51 



since there were other Nineteens, of course, in each age group. 
And today, now that the new Elevens had been advanced this 
morning, there were two Eleven-nineteens. At the midday break he 
had exchanged smiles with the new one, a shy female named 
Harriet. 

But the duplication was only for these few hours. Very soon he 
would not be an Eleven but a Twelve, and age would no longer 
matter. He would be an adult, like his parents, though a new one 
and untrained still. 

Asher was Four, and sat now in the row ahead of Jonas. He would 
receive his Assignment fourth. 

Fiona, Eighteen, was on his left; on his other side sat Twenty, a 
male named Pierre whom Jonas didn't like much. Pierre was very 
serious, not much fun, and a worrier and tattletale, too. "Have you 
checked the rules, Jonas?" Pierre was always whispering solemnly. 
"I'm not sure that's within the rules." Usually it was some foolish

thing that no one cared about-opening his tunic if it was a day with 
a breeze; taking a brief try on a friend's bicycle, just to experience 
the different feel of it. 

The initial speech at the Ceremony of Twelve was made by the 
Chief Elder, the leader of the community who was elected every ten 
years. The speech was much the same each year: recollection of 
the time of childhood and the period of preparation, the coming 
responsibilities of adult life, the profound importance of Assignment, 
the seriousness of training to come. 

Then the Chief Elder moved ahead in her speech. "This is the 
time," she began, looking directly at them, "when we acknowledge 
differences. You Elevens have spent all your years till now learning 
to fit in, to 



52 



standardize your behavior, to curb any impulse that might set you 
apart from the group. 

"But today we honor your differences. They have determined your 
futures." 

She began to describe this year's group and its variety of 
personalities, though she singled no one out by name. She 
mentioned that there was one who had singular skills at caretaking, 
another who loved newchildren, one with unusual scientific 
aptitude, and a fourth for whom physical labor was an obvious 
pleasure. Jonas shifted in his seat, trying to recognize each 
reference as one of his groupmates. The caretaking skills were no 
doubt those of Fiona, on his left; he remembered noticing the 
tenderness with which she had bathed the Old. Probably the one 
with scientific aptitude was Benjamin, the male who had devised 
new, important equipment for the Rehabilitation Center. He heard

nothing that he recognized as himself, Jonas. Finally the Chief 
Elder paid tribute to the hard work of her committee, which had 
performed the observations so meticulously all year. The 
Committee of Elders stood and was acknowledged by applause. 
Jonas noticed Asher yawn slightly, covering his mouth politely with 
his hand. 

Then, at last, the Chief Elder called number One to the stage, and 
the Assignments began. 

Each announcement was lengthy, accompanied by a speech 
directed at the new Twelve. Jonas tried to pay attention as One, 
smiling happily, received her Assignment as Fish Hatchery 
Attendant along with words of praise for her childhood spent doing 
many volunteer hours there, and her obvious interest in the 
important process of providing nourishment for the community. 



53 



Number One-her name was Madeline-returned, finally, amidst 
applause, to her seat, wearing the new badge that designated her 
Fish Hatchery Attendant. Jonas was certainly glad that that 
Assignment was taken; he wouldn't have wanted it. But he gave 
Madeline a smile of congratulation. 

When Two, a female named Inger, received her Assignment as 
Birthmother, Jonas remembered that his mother had called it a job 
without honor. But he thought that the Committee had chosen well. 
Inger was a nice girl though somewhat lazy, and her body was 
strong. She would enjoy the three years of being pampered that 
would follow her brief training; she would give birth easily and well; 
and the task of Laborer that would follow would use her strength, 
keep her healthy, and impose self-discipline. Inger was smiling 
when she resumed her seat. Birthmother was an important job, if 
lacking in prestige.

Jonas noticed that Asher looked nervous. He kept turning his head 
and glancing back at Jonas until the group leader had to give him a 
silent chastisement, a motion to sit still and face forward. 

Three, Isaac, was given an .Assignment as Instructor of Sixes, 
which obviously pleased him and was well deserved. Now there 
were three Assignments gone, none of them ones that Jonas would 
have liked not that he could have been a Birthmother, anyway, he 
realized with amusement. He tried to sort through the list in his 
mind, the possible Assignments that remained. But there were so 
many he gave it up; and anyway, now it was Asher's turn. He paid 
strict attention as his friend went to the stage and stood self- 
consciously beside the Chief Elder. 



54 



"All of us in the community know and enjoy Asher," the Chief Elder 
began. Asher grinned and scratched one leg with the other foot. 
The audience chuckled softly. 

"When the committee began to consider Asher's Assignment," she 
went on, "there were some possibilities that were immediately 
discarded. Some that would clearly not have been right for Asher. 

"For example," she said, smiling, "we did not consider for an instant 
designating Asher an Instructor of Threes." 

The audience howled with laughter. Asher laughed, too, looking 
sheepish but pleased at the special attention. The Instructors of 
Threes were in charge of the acquisition of correct language. 

"In fact," the Chief Elder continued, chuckling a little herself, "we 
even gave a little thought to some retroactive chastisement for the 
one who had been Asher's Instructor of Threes so long ago. At the 
meeting where Asher was discussed, we retold many of the stories 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 58 of 182 



that we all remembered from his days of language acquisition. 

"Especially," she said, chuckling, "the difference between snack 
and smack. Remember, Asher?" 

Asher nodded ruefully, and the audience laughed aloud. Jonas did, 
too. He remembered, though he had been only a Three at the time 
himself. 

The punishment used for small children was a regulated system of 
smacks with the discipline wand: a thin, flexible weapon that stung 
painfully when it was wielded. The Childcare specialists were 
trained very carefully in the discipline methods: a quick smack 
across the hands for a bit of minor misbehavior; three sharper 
smacks on the bare legs for a second offense. 



55 



Poor Asher, who always talked too fast and mixed up words, even 
as a toddler. As a Three, eager for his juice and crackers at 
snacktime, he one day said "smack" instead of "snack" as he stood 
waiting in line for the morning treat. 

Jonas remembered it clearly. He could still see little Asher, wiggling 
with impatience in the line. He remembered the cheerful voice call 
out, "I want my smack!" 

The other Threes, including Jonas, had laughed nervously. 
"Snack!" they corrected. "You meant snack, Asher!" But the mistake 
had been made. And precision of language was one of the most 
important tasks of small children. Asher had asked for a smack. 

The discipline wand, in the hand of the Childcare worker, whistled 
as it came down across Asher's hands. Asher whimpered, cringed, 
and corrected himself instantly. "Snack," he whispered. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 59 of 182 



But the next morning he had done it again. And again the following 
week. He couldn't seem to stop, though for each lapse the 
discipline wand came again, escalating to a series of painful lashes 
that left marks on Asher's legs. Eventually, for a period of time, 
Asher stopped talking altogether, when he was a Three. 

"For a while," the Chief Elder said, relating the story, "we had a 
silent Asher! But he learned." 

She turned to him with a smile. "When he began to talk again, it 
was with greater precision. And now his lapses are very few. His 
corrections and apologies are very prompt. And his good humor is 
unfailing." The audience murmured in agreement. Asher's cheerful 
disposition was well-known throughout the community. 



56 



"Asher." She lifted her voice to make the official announcement. 
"We have given you the Assignment of Assistant Director of 
Recreation." 

She clipped on his new badge as he stood beside her, beaming. 
Then he turned and left the stage as the audience cheered. When 
he had taken his seat again, the Chief Elder looked down at him 
and said the words that she had said now four times, and would 
say to each new Twelve. Somehow she gave it special meaning for 
each of them. 

"Asher," she said, "thank you for your childhood." 

The Assignments continued, and Jonas watched and listened, 
relieved now by the wonderful Assignment his best friend had been 
given. But he was more and more apprehensive as his own 
approached. Now the new Twelves in the row ahead had all 
received their badges. They were fingering them as they sat, and 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 60 of 182 



Jonas knew that each one was thinking about the training that lay 
ahead. For some-one studious male had been selected as Doctor, 
a female as Engineer, and another for Law and Justice-it would be 
years of hard work and study. Others, like Laborers and 
Birthmothers, would have a much shorter training period. 

Eighteen, Fiona, on his left, was ca]led. Jonas knew she must be 
nervous, but Fiona was a calm female. She had been sitting quietly, 
serenely, throughout the Ceremony. 

Even the applause, though enthusiastic, seemed serene when 
Fiona was given the important Assignment of Caretaker of the Old. 
It was perfect for such a sensitive, gentle girl, and her smile was 
satisfied and pleased when she took her seat beside him again. 



57 



Jonas prepared himself to walk to the stage when the applause 
ended and the Chief Elder picked up the next folder and looked 
down to the group to call forward the next new Twelve. He was 
calm now that his turn had come. He took a deep breath and 
smoothed his hair with his hand. 

"Twenty," he heard her voice say clearly. "Pierre." 

She skipped me, Jonas thought, stunned. Had he heard wrong? 
No. There was a sudden hush in the crowd, and he knew that the 
entire community realized that the Chief Elder had moved from 
Eighteen to Twenty, leaving a gap. On his right, Pierre, with a 
startled look, rose from his seat and moved to the stage. 

A mistake. She made a mistake. But Jonas knew, even as he had 
the thought, that she hadn't. The Chief Elder made no mistakes. 
Not at the Ceremony of Twelve. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 61 of 182 



He felt dizzy, and couldn't focus his attention. He didn't hear what 
Assignment Pierre received, and was only dimly aware of the 
applause as the boy returned, wearing his new badge. Then: 
Twenty-one. Twenty-two. 

The numbers continued in order. Jonas sat, dazed, as they moved 
into the Thirties and then the Forties, nearing the end. Each time, at 
each announcement, his heart jumped for a moment, and he 
thought wild thoughts. Perhaps now she would call his name. Could 
he have forgotten his own number? No. He had always been 
Nineteen. He was sitting in the seat marked Nineteen. 

But she had skipped him. He saw the others in his group glance at 
him, embarrassed, and then avert their eyes quickly. He saw a 
worried look on the face of his group leader. 



58 



He hunched his shoulders and tried to make himself smaller in the 
seat. He wanted to disappear, to fade away, not to exist. He didn't 
dare to turn and find his parents in the crowd. He couldn't bear to 
see their faces darkened with shame. 

Jonas bowed his head and searched through his mind. What had 
he done wrong? 



59 



8 

The audience was clearly ill at ease. They applauded at the final 
Assignment; but the applause was piecemeal, no longer a 
crescendo of united enthusiasm. There were murmurs of confusion. 

Jonas moved his hands together, clapping, but it was an automatic, 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 62 of 182 



meaningless gesture that he wasn't even aware of. His mind had 
shut out all of the earlier emotions: the anticipation, excitement, 
pride, and even the happy kinship with his friends. Now he felt only 
humiliation and terror. 

The Chief Elder waited until the uneasy applause subsided. Then 
she spoke again. 

"I know," she said in her vibrant, gracious voice, "that you are all 
concerned. That you feel I have made a mistake." 

She smiled. The community, relieved from its discomfort very 
slightly by her benign statement, seemed to breathe more easily. It 
was very silent. 

Jonas looked up. 

"I have caused you anxiety," she said. "I apologize to my 
community." Her voice flowed over the assembled crowd. 



60 



"We accept your apology," they all uttered together. 

"Jonas," she said, looking down at him, "I apologize to you in 
particular. I caused you anguish." 

"I accept your apology," Jonas replied shakily. 

"Please come to the stage now." 

Earlier that day, dressing in his own dwelling, he had practiced the 
kind of jaunty, self-assured walk that he hoped he could make to 
the stage when his turn came. All of that was forgotten now. He 
simply willed himself to stand, to move his feet that felt weighted 
and clumsy, to go forward, up the steps and across the platform 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010

until he stood at her side. 

Reassuringly she placed her arm across his tense shoulders. 

"Jonas has not been assigned," she informed the crowd, and his 
heart sank. 

Then she went on. "Jonas has been selected." 

He blinked. What did that mean? He felt a collective, questioning 
stir from the audience. They, too, were puzzled. 

In a firm, commanding voice she announced, "Jonas has been 
selected to be our next Receiver of Memory." 

Then he heard the gasp-the sudden intake of breath, drawn 
sharply in astonishment, by each of the seated citizens. He saw 
their faces; the eyes widened in awe. 

And still he did not understand. 

"Such a selection is very, very rare," the Chief Elder told the 
audience. "Our community has only one Receiver. It is he who 
trains his successor. 

"We have had our current Receiver for a very long time," she went 
on. Jonas followed her eyes and saw that 



61 



she was looking at one of the Elders. The Committee of Elders was 
sitting together in a group; and the Chief Elder's eyes were now on 
one who sat in the midst but seemed oddly separate from them. It 
was a man Jonas had never noticed before, a bearded man with 
pale eyes. He was watching Jonas intently. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 64 of 182 



"We failed in our last selection," the Chief Elder said solemnly. "It 
was ten years ago, when Jonas was just a toddler. I will not dwell 
on the experience because it causes us all terrible discomfort." 

Jonas didn't know what she was referring to, but he could sense the 
discomfort of the audience. They shifted uneasily in their seats. 

"We have not been hasty this time," she continued. "We could not 
afford another failure." 

"Sometimes," she went on, speaking now in a lighter tone, relaxing 
the tension in the Auditorium, "we are not entirely certain about the 
Assignments, even after the most painstaking observations. 
Sometimes we worry that the one assigned might not develop, 
through training, every attribute necessary. Elevens are still 
children, after all. What we observe as playfulness and patience- 
the requirements to become Nurturer-could, with maturity, be 
revealed as simply foolishness and indolence. So we continue to 
observe during training, and to modify behavior when necessary. 

"But the Receiver-in-training cannot be observed, cannot be 
modified. That is stated quite clearly in the rules. He is to be alone, 
apart, while he is prepared by the current Receiver for the job which 
is the most honored in our community." 



62 



Alone? Apart? Jonas listened with increasing unease. "Therefore 
the selection must be sound. It must be a unanimous choice of the 
Committee. They can have no doubts, however fleeting. If, during 
the process, an Elder reports a dream of uncertainty, that dream 
has the power to set a candidate aside instantly. 

"Jonas was identified as a possible Receiver many years ago. We 
have observed him meticulously. There were no dreams of 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 65 of 182 



uncertainty. 

"He has shown all of the qualities that a Receiver must have." 

With her hand still firmly on his shoulder, the Chief Elder listed the 
qualities. 

"Intelligence," she said. "We are all aware that Jonas has been a 
top student throughout his school days. 

"Integrity," she said next. "Jonas has, like all of us, committed minor 
transgressions." She smiled at him. "We expect that. We hoped, 
also, that he would present himself promptly for chastisement, and 
he has always done so. 

" Courage ," she went on. "Only one of us here today has ever 
undergone the rigorous training required of a Receiver. He, of 
course, is the most important member of the Committee: the current 
Receiver. It was he who reminded us, again and again, of the 
courage required. 

"Jonas," she said, turning to him, but speaking in a voice that the 
entire community could hear, "the training required of you involves 
pain. Physical pain." 

He felt fear flutter within him. 

"You have never experienced that. Yes, you have scraped your 
knees in falls from your bicycle. Yes, you crushed your finger in a 
door last year." 



63 



Jonas nodded, agreeing, as he recalled the incident, and its 
accompanying misery. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 66 of 182 



"But you will be faced, now," she explained gently, "with pain of a 
magnitude that none of us here can comprehend because it is 
beyond our experience. The Receiver himself was not able to 
describe it, only to remind us that you would be faced with it, that 
you would need immense courage. We cannot prepare you for that. 

"But we feel certain that you are brave," she said to him. 

He did not feel brave at all. Not now. 

"The fourth essential attribute," the Chief Elder said, "is wisdom. 
Jonas has not yet acquired that. The acquisition of wisdom will 
come through his training. 

"We are convinced that Jonas has the ability to acquire wisdom. 
That is what we looked for. 

"Finally, The Receiver must have one more quality, and it is one 
which I can only name, but not describe. I do not understand it. You 
members of the community will not understand it, either. Perhaps 
Jonas will, because the current Receiver has told us that Jonas 
already has this quality. He calls it the Capacity to See Beyond." 

The Chief Elder looked at Jonas with a question in her eyes. The 
audience watched him, too. They were silent. 

For a moment he froze, consumed with despair. He didn't have it, 
the whatever-she-had-said. He didn't know what it was. Now was 
the moment when he would have to confess, to say, "No, I don't. I 
can't, "and throw himself on their mercy, ask their forgiveness, to 
explain that he had been wrongly chosen, that he was not the right 
one at all.

But when he looked out across the crowd, the sea of faces, the 
thing happened again. The thing that had happened with the apple. 

They changed. 

He blinked, and it was gone. His shoulders straightened slightly. 
Briefly he felt a tiny sliver of sureness for the first time. 

She was still watching him. They all were. 

"I think it's true," he told the Chief Elder and the community. "I don't 
understand it yet. I don't know what it is. But sometimes I see 
something. And maybe it's beyond." 

She took her arm from his shoulders. 

"Jonas," she said, speaking not to him alone but to the entire 
community of which he was a part, "you will be trained to be our 
next Receiver of Memory. We thank you for your childhood." 

Then she turned and left the stage, left him there alone, standing 
and facing the crowd, which began spontaneously the collective 
murmur of his name. 

"Jonas." It was a whisper at first: hushed, barely audible. "Jonas. 
Jonas." 

Then louder, faster. "JONAS. JONAS. JONAS." With the chant, 
Jonas knew, the community was accepting him and his new role, 
giving him life, the way they had given it to the newchild Caleb. His 
heart swelled with gratitude and pride. 

But at the same time he was filled with fear. He did not know what 
his selection meant. He did not know what he was to become. 

Or what would become of him.

65 



Now, for the first time in his twelve years of life, Jonas felt separate, 
different. He remembered what the Chief Elder had said: that his 
training would be alone and apart. 

But his training had not yet begun and already, upon leaving the 
Auditorium, he felt the apartness. Holding the folder she had given 
him, he made his way through the throng, looking for his family unit 
and for Asher. People moved aside for him. They watched him. He 
thought he could hear whispers. 

"Ash!" he called, spotting his friend near the rows of bicycles. "Ride 
back with me?" 

"Sure." Asher smiled, his usual smile, friendly and familiar. But 
Jonas felt a moment of hesitation from his friend, an uncertainty. 

"Congratulations," Asher said. 

"You too," Jonas replied. "It was really funny, when she told about 
the smacks. You got more applause than almost anybody else." 

The other new Twelves clustered nearby, placing their folders 
carefully into the carrying containers on the backs of the bikes. In 
each dwelling tonight they would be 



66 



studying the instructions for the beginning of their training. Each 
night for years the children had memorized the required lessons for 
school, often yawning with boredom. Tonight they would all begin 
eagerly to memorize the rules for their adult Assignments. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 69 of 182 



"Congratulations, Asher!" someone called. Then that hesitation 
again. "You too, Jonas!" 

Asher and Jonas responded with congratulations to their 
groupmates. Jonas saw his parents watching him from the place 
where their own bicycles were waiting. Lily had already been 
strapped into her seat. 

He waved. They waved back, smiling, but he noticed that Lily was 
watching him solemnly, her thumb in her mouth. 

He rode directly to his dwelling, exchanging only small jokes and 
unimportant remarks with Asher. 

"See you in the morning, Recreation Director!" he called, 
dismounting by his door as Asher continued on. 

"Right! See you!" Asher called back. Once again, there was just a 
moment when things weren't quite the same, weren't quite as they 
had always been through the long friendship. Perhaps he had 
imagined it. Things couldn't change, with Asher. 

The evening meal was quieter than usual. Lily chattered about her 
plans for volunteer work; she would begin, she said, at the 
Nurturing Center, since she was already an expert at feeding 
Gabriel. 

"I know," she added quickly, when her father gave her a warning 
glance, "I won't mention his name. I know I'm not supposed to know 
his name. 



"I can't wait for tomorrow to come," she said happily. 
Jonas sighed uneasily. "I can," he muttered.

"You've been greatly honored," his mother said. "Your father and I 
are very proud." 

"It's the most important job in the community," Father said. 

"But just the other night, you said that the job of making 
Assignments was the most important!" 

Mother nodded. "This is different. It's not a job, really. I never 
thought, never expected--" She paused. "There's only one 
Receiver." 

"But the Chief Elder said that they had made a selection before, 
and that it failed. What was she talking about?" 

Both of his parents hesitated. Finally his father described the 
previous selection. "It was very much as it was today, Jonas- the 
same suspense, as one Eleven had been passed over when the 
Assignments were given. Then the announcement, when they 
singled out the one-" 

Jonas interrupted. "What was his name?" 

His mother replied, "Her, not his. It was a female. But we are never 
to speak the name, or to use it again for a newchild." 

Jonas was shocked. A name designated Not-to-Be-Spoken 
indicated the highest degree of disgrace. 

"What happened to her?" he asked nervously. 

But his parents looked blank. "We don't know," his father said 
uncomfortably. "We never saw her again."

10/19/2010

Page 71 of 182 



A silence fell over the room. They looked at each other. Finally his 
mother, rising from the table, said, "You've been greatly honored, 
Jonas. Greatly honored." 

Alone in his sleepingroom, prepared for bed, Jonas opened his 
folder at last. Some of the other Twelves, he had 



68 



noticed, had been given folders thick with printed pages. He 
imagined Benjamin, the scientific male in his group, beginning to 
read pages of rules and instructions with relish. He pictured Fiona 
smiling her gentle smile as she bent over the lists of duties and 
methods that she would be required to learn in the days to come. 

But his own folder was startlingly close to empty. Inside there was 
only a single printed sheet. He read it twice. 

JONAS 

RECEIVER OF MEMORY 

1 . Go immediately at the end of school hours each day to the 
Annex entrance behind the House of the Old and present yourself 
to the attendant. 

2. Go immediately to your dwelling at the conclusion of Training 
Hours each day. 

3. From this moment you are exempted from rules governing 
rudeness. You may ask any question of any citizen and you will 
receive answers. 

4. Do not discuss your training with any other member of the 
community, including parents and Elders.

5. From this moment you are prohibited from dream-telling. 

6. Except for illness or injury unrelated to your training, do not apply 
for any medication. 

7. You are not permitted to apply for release. 

8. You may lie. 



69 



Jonas was stunned. What would happen to his friendships? His 
mindless hours playing ball, or riding his bike along the river? 
Those had been happy and vital times for him. Were they to be 
completely taken from him, now? The simple logistic instructions- 
where to go, and when-were expected. Every Twelve had to be 
told, of course, where and how and when to report for training. But 
he was a little dismayed that his schedule left no time, apparently, 
for recreation. 

The exemption from rudeness startled him. Reading it again, 
however, he realized that it didn't compel him to be rude; it simply 
allowed him the option. He was quite certain he would never take 
advantage of it. He was so completely, so thoroughly accustomed 
to courtesy within the community that the thought of asking another 
citizen an intimate question, of calling someone's attention to an 
area of awkwardness, was unnerving. 

The prohibition of dream-telling, he thought, would not be a real 
problem. He dreamed so rarely that the dream-telling did not come 
easily to him anyway, and he was glad to be excused from it. He 
wondered briefly, though, how to deal with it at the morning meal. 
What if he did dream-should he simply tell his family unit, as he did 
so often, anyway, that he hadn't? That would be a lie. Still, the final 
rule said ... well, he wasn't quite ready to think about the final rule 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 73 of 182 



on the page. 

The restriction of medication unnerved him. Medication was always 
available to citizens, even to children, through their parents. When 
he had crushed his finger in the door, he had quickly, gasping into 
the speaker, notified his mother; she had hastily requisitioned relief- 
of-pain 



70 



medication which had promptly been delivered to his dwelling. 
Almost instantly the excruciating pain in his hand had diminished to 
the throb which was, now, all he could recall of the experience. 

Re-reading rule number 6, he realized that a crushed finger fell into 
the category of "unrelated to training." So if it ever happened again- 
-and he was quite certain it wouldn't; he had been very careful near 
heavy doors since the accident!-he could still receive medication. 

The pill he took now, each morning, was also unrelated to training. 
So he would continue to receive the pill. 

But he remembered uneasily what the Chief Elder had said about 
the pain that would come with his training. She had called it 
indescribable. 

Jonas swallowed hard, trying without success to imagine what such 
pain might be like, with no medication at all. But it was beyond his 
comprehension. 

He felt no reaction to rule number 7 at all. It had never occurred to 
him that under any circumstances, ever, he might apply for release. 

Finally he steeled himself to read the final rule again. He had been 
trained since earliest childhood, since his earliest learning of

10/19/2010

language, never to lie. It was an integral part of the learning of 
precise speech. Once, when he had been a Four, he had said, just 
prior to the midday meal at school, "I'm starving." 

Immediately he had been taken aside for a brief private lesson in 
language precision. He was not starving, it was pointed out. He was 
hungry. No one in the community was starving, had ever been 
starving, would ever be starving. To say "starving" was to speak a 
lie. An unintentioned 






71 



lie, of course. But the reason for precision of language was to 
ensure that unintentional lies were never uttered. Did he 
understand that? they asked him. And he had. 

He had never, within his memory, been tempted to lie. Asher did 
not lie. Lily did not lie. His parents did not lie. No one did. Unless ... 

Now Jonas had a thought that he had never had before. This new 
thought was frightening. What if others-adult-- had, upon becoming 
Twelves, received in their instructions the same terrifying 
sentence? 

What if they had all been instructed: You may lie? 

His mind reeled. Now, empowered to ask questions of utmost 
rudeness and promised answers-he could, conceivably (though it 
was almost unimaginable), ask someone, some adult, his father 
perhaps: "Do you lie?" 

But he would have no way of knowing if the answer he received 
were true.

"I go in here, Jonas," Fiona told him when they reached the front 
door of the House of the Old after parking their bicycles in the 
designated area. 

"I don't know why I'm nervous," she confessed. "I've been here so 
often before." She turned her folder over in her hands. 

"Well, everything's different now," Jonas reminded her. 

"Even the nameplates on our bikes," Fiona laughed. During the 
night the nameplate of each new Twelve had been removed by the 
Maintenance Crew and replaced with the style that indicated 
citizen-in-training. 

"I don't want to be late," she said hastily, and started up the steps. 
"If we finish at the same time, I'll ride home with you." 

Jonas nodded, waved to her, and headed around the building 
toward the Annex, a small wing attached to the back. He certainly 
didn't want to be late for his first day of training, either. 

The Annex was very ordinary, its door unremarkable. He reached 
for the heavy handle, then noticed a buzzer on the wall. So he 
buzzed instead. 



73 



"Yes?" The voice came through a small speaker above the buzzer. 



"It's, uh, Jonas. I'm the new~l mean--" 



"Come in." A click indicated that the door had been unlatched. 



The lobby was very small and contained only a desk at which a

Page 76 of 182 



female Attendant sat working on some papers. She looked up when 
he entered; then, to his surprise, she stood. It was a small thing, the 
standing; but no one had ever stood automatically to acknowledge 
Jonas's presence before. 

"Welcome, Receiver of Memory," she said respectfully. 

"Oh, please," he replied uncomfortably. "Call me Jonas." 

She smiled, pushed a button, and he heard a click that unlocked 
the door to her left. "You may go right on in," she told him. 

Then she seemed to notice his discomfort and to realize its origin. 
No doors in the community were locked, ever. None that Jonas 
knew of, anyway. 

"The locks are simply to insure The Receiver's privacy because he 
needs concentration," she explained. "It would be difficult if citizens 
wandered in, looking for the Department of Bicycle Repair, or 
something." 

Jonas laughed, relaxing a little. The woman seemed very friendly, 
and it was true~in fact it was a joke throughout the community-that 
the Department of Bicycle Repair, an unimportant little office, was 
relocated so often that no one ever knew where it was. 

"There is nothing dangerous here," she told him. 

"But," she added, glancing at the wall clock, "he doesn't like to be 
kept waiting." 



74 



Jonas hurried through the door and found himself in a comfortably 
furnished living area. It was not unlike his own family unit's dwelling. 
Furniture was standard throughout the community: practical, sturdy, 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 77 of 182 



the function of each piece clearly defined. A bed for sleeping. A 
table for eating. A desk for studying. 

All of those things were in this spacious room, though each was 
slightly different from those in his own dwelling. The fabrics on the 
upholstered chairs and sofa were slightly thicker and more 
luxurious; the table legs were not straight like those at home, but 
slender and curved, with a small carved decoration at the foot. The 
bed, in an alcove at the far end of the room, was draped with a 
splendid cloth embroidered over its entire surface with intricate 
designs. 

But the most conspicuous difference was the books. In his own 
dwelling, there were the necessary reference volumes that each 
household contained: a dictionary, and the thick community volume 
which contained descriptions of every office, factory, building, and 
committee. And the Book of Rules, of course. 

The books in his own dwelling were the only books that Jonas had 
ever seen. He had never known that other books existed. 

But this room's walls were completely covered by bookcases, filled, 
which reached to the ceiling. There must have been hundreds- 
perhaps thousands-of books, their titles embossed in shiny letters. 

Jonas stared at them. He couldn't imagine what the thousands of 
pages contained. Could there be rules beyond the rules that 
governed the community? Could there be 



75 



more descriptions of offices and factories and committees? 

He had only a second to look around because he was aware that 
the man sitting in a chair beside the table was watching him. Hastily 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 78 of 182 



he moved forward, stood before the man, bowed slightly, and said, 
"I'm Jonas." 

"I know. Welcome, Receiver of Memory." 

Jonas recognized the man. He was the Elder who had seemed 
separate from the others at the Ceremony, though he was dressed 
in the same special clothing that only Elders wore. 

Jonas looked self-consciously into the pale eyes that mirrored his 
own. 

"Sir, I apologize for my lack of understanding " 



He waited, but the man did not give the standard accepting-of- 
apology response. 

After a moment, Jonas went on, "But I thought—l mean I think," he 
corrected, reminding himself that if precision of language were ever 
to be important, it was certainly important now, in the presence of 
this man, "that you are the Receiver of Memory. I'm only, well, I was 
only assigned, I mean selected, yesterday. I'm not anything at all. 
Not yet." 

The man looked at him thoughtfully, silently. It was a look that 
combined interest, curiosity, concern, and perhaps a little sympathy 
as well. 

Finally he spoke. "Beginning today, this moment, at least to me, 
you are the Receiver. 

"I have been the Receiver for a long time. A very, very long time. 
You can see that, can't you?" 

Jonas nodded. The man was wrinkled, and his eyes, though 
piercing in their unusual lightness, seemed tired.

The flesh around them was darkened into shadowed circles. 

"I can see that you are very old," Jonas responded with respect. 
The Old were always given the highest respect. 

The man smiled. He touched the sagging flesh on his own face with 
amusement. "I am not, actually, as old as I look," he told Jonas. 
"This job has aged me. I know I look as if I should be scheduled for 
release very soon. But actually I have a good deal of time left. 

"I was pleased, though, when you were selected. It took them a 
long time. The failure of the previous selection was ten years ago, 
and my energy is starting to diminish. I need what strength I have 
remaining for your training. We have hard and painful work to do, 
you and I. 

"Please sit down," he said, and gestured toward the nearby chair. 
Jonas lowered himself onto the soft cushioned seat. 

The man dosed his eyes and continued speaking. "When I became 
a Twelve, I was selected, as you were. I was frightened, as I'm sure 
you are." He opened his eyes for a moment and peered at Jonas, 
who nodded. 

The eyes closed again. "I came to this very room to begin my 
training. It was such a long time ago. 

"The previous Receiver seemed just as old to me as I do to you. He 
was just as tired as I am today." 

He sat forward suddenly, opened his eyes, and said, "You may ask 
questions. I have so little experience in describing this process. It is 
forbidden to talk of it."

Page 80 of 182 



"I know, sir. I have read the instructions," Jonas said. 

"So I may neglect to make things as clear as I should." The man 
chuckled. "My job is important and has enormous honor. But that 
does not mean I am perfect, and 



77 



when I tried before to train a successor, I failed. Please ask any 
questions that will help you." 

In his mind, Jonas had questions. A thousand. A million questions. 
As many questions as there were books lining the walls. But he did 
not ask one, not yet. 

The man sighed, seeming to put his thoughts in order. Then he 
spoke again. "Simply stated," he said, "although it's not really 
simple at all, my job is to transmit to you all the memories I have 
within me. Memories of the past." 

"Sir," Jonas said tentatively, "I would be very interested to hear the 
story of your life, and to listen to your memories. 

"I apologize for interrupting," he added quickly. 

The man waved his hand impatiently. "No apologies in this room. 
We haven't time." 

"Well," Jonas went on, uncomfortably aware that he might be 
interrupting again, "I am really interested, I don't mean that I'm not. 
But I don't exactly understand why it's so important. I could do 
some adult job in the community, and in my recreation time I could 
come and listen to the stories from your childhood. I'd like that. 
Actually," he added, "I've done that already, in the House of the 
Old. The Old like to tell about their childhoods, and it's always fun to 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 81 of 182 



listen." 

The man shook his head. "No, no," he said. "I'm not being clear. It's 
not my past, not my childhood that I must transmit to you." 

He leaned back, resting his head against the back of the 
upholstered chair. "It's the memories of the whole world," he said 
with a sigh. "Before you, before me, before the previous Receiver, 
and generations before him." 

Jonas frowned. "The whole world?" he asked. "I don't 



78 



understand. Do you mean not just us? Not just the community? Do 
you mean Elsewhere, too?" He tried, in his mind, to grasp the 
concept. "I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand exactly. Maybe I'm not 
smart enough. I don't know what you mean when you say 'the 
whole world' or 'generations before him.' I thought there was only 
us. I thought there was only now." 

"There's much more. There's all that goes beyond-all that is 
Elsewhere--and all that goes back, and back, and back. I received 
all of those, when I was selected. And here in this room, all alone, I 
re-experience them again and again. It is how wisdom comes. And 
how we shape our future." 

He rested for a moment, breathing deeply. "I am so weighted with 
them," he said. 

Jonas felt a terrible concern for the man, suddenly. 

"It's as if ... " The man paused, seeming to search his mind for the 
right words of description. "It's like going downhill through deep 
snow on a sled," he said, finally. "At first it's exhilarating: the speed; 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 82 of 182 



the sharp, clear air; but then the snow accumulates, builds up on 
the runners, and you slow, you have to push hard to keep going, 
and--" 

He shook his head suddenly, and peered at Jonas. "That meant 
nothing to you, did it?" he asked. 

Jonas was confused. "I didn't understand it, sir." 

"Of course you didn't. You don't know what snow is, do you?" 

Jonas shook his head. 

"Or a sled? Runners?" 

"No, sir," Jonas said. 



79 



"Downhill? The term means nothing to you?" 

"Nothing, sir." 

"Well, it's a place to start. I'd been wondering how to begin. Move to 
the bed, and lie face down. Remove your tunic first." 

Jonas did so, a little apprehensively. Beneath his bare chest, he felt 
the soft folds of the magnificent cloth that covered the bed. He 
watched as the man rose and moved first to the wall where the 
speaker was. It was the same sort of speaker that occupied a place 
in every dwelling, but one thing about it was different. This one had 
a switch, which the man deftly snapped to the end that said OFF. 

Jonas almost gasped aloud. To have the power to turn the speaker 
off! It was an astonishing thing. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 83 of 182 



Then the man moved with surprising quickness to the corner where 
the bed was. He sat on a chair beside Jonas, who was motionless, 
waiting for what would happen next. 

"Close your eyes. Relax. This will not be painful." 

Jonas remembered that he was allowed, that he had even been 
encouraged, to ask questions. "What are you going to do, sir?" he 
asked, hoping that his voice didn't betray his nervousness. 

"I am going to transmit the memory of snow," the old man said, and 
placed his hands on Jonas's bare back. 



80 



11 

Jonas felt nothing unusual at first. He felt only the light touch of the 
old man's hands on his back. 

He tried to relax, to breathe evenly. The room was absolutely silent, 
and for a moment Jonas feared that he might disgrace himself now, 
on the first day of his training, by falling asleep. 

Then he shivered. He realized that the touch of the hands felt, 
suddenly, cold. At the same instant, breathing in, he felt the air 
change, and his very breath was cold. He licked his lips, and in 
doing so, his tongue touched the suddenly chilled air. 

It was very startling; but he was not at all frightened, now. He was 
filled with energy, and he breathed again, feeling the sharp intake 
of frigid air. Now, too, he could feel cold air swirling around his 
entire body. He felt it blow against his hands where they lay at his 
sides, and over his back. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 84 of 182 



The touch of the man's hands seemed to have disappeared. 

Now he became aware of an entirely new sensation: pinpricks? No, 
because they were soft and without pain. Tiny, cold, featherlike 
feelings peppered his body and face. He put out his tongue again, 
and caught one of the 



81 



dots of cold upon it. It disappeared from his awareness instantly; 
but he caught another, and another. The sensation made him 
smile. 

One part of his consciousness knew that he was still lying there, on 
the bed, in the Annex room. Yet another, separate part of his being 
was upright now, in a sitting position, and beneath him he could feel 
that he was not on the soft decorated bedcovering at all, but rather 
seated on a flat, hard surface. His hands now held (though at the 
same time they were still motionless at his sides) a rough, damp 
rope. 

And he could see, though his eyes were closed. He could see a 
bright, whirling torrent of crystals in the air around him, and he 
could see them gather on the backs of his hands, like cold fur. 

His breath was visible. 

Beyond, through the swirl of what he now, somehow, perceived 
was the thing the old man had spoken of-- snow-- he could look out 
and down a great distance. He was up high someplace. The ground 
was thick with the furry snow, but he sat slightly above it on a hard, 
flat object. 

Sled, he knew abruptly. He was sitting on a thing called sled. And 
the sled itself seemed to be poised at the top of a long, extended 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 85 of 182 



mound that rose from the very land where he was. Even as he 
thought the word "mound," his new consciousness told him hill. 

Then the sled, with Jonas himself upon it, began to move through 
the snowfall, and he understood instantly that now he was going 
downhill. No voice made an explanation. The experience explained 
itself to him. 

His face cut through the frigid air as he began the 



82 



descent, moving through the substance called snow on the vehicle 
called sled, which propelled itself on what he now knew without 
doubt to be runners. 

Comprehending all of those things as he sped downward, he was 
free to enjoy the breathless glee that overwhelmed him: the speed, 
the clear cold air, the total silence, the feeling of balance and 
excitement and peace. 

Then, as the angle of incline lessened, as the mound-the hill- 
flattened, nearing the bottom, the sled's forward motion slowed. 
The snow was piled now around it, and he pushed with his body, 
moving it forward, not wanting the exhilarating ride to end. 

Finally the obstruction of the piled snow was too much for the thin 
runners of the sled, and he came to a stop. He sat there for a 
moment, panting, holding the rope in his cold hands. Tentatively he 
opened his eyes~not his snow-hill-sled eyes, for they had been 
open throughout the strange ride. He opened his ordinary eyes, 
and saw that he was still on the bed, that he had not moved at all. 

The old man, still beside the bed, was watching him. "How do you 
feel?" he asked. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 86 of 182 



Jonas sat up and tried to answer honestly. "Surprised," he said, 
after a moment. 

The old man wiped his forehead with his sleeve. "Whew," he said. 
"It was exhausting. But you know, even transmitting that tiny 
memory to you-l think it lightened me just a little." 

"Do you mean~you did say I could ask questions?" 

The man nodded, encouraging his question. 

"Do you mean that now you don't have the memory of it — of that ride 
on the sled-anymore?" 



83 



"That's right. A little weight off this old body." 

"But it was such fun! And now you don't have it anymore! I took it 
from you!" 

But the old man laughed. "All I gave you was one ride, on one sled, 
in one snow, on one hill. I have a whole world of them in my 
memory. I could give them to you one by one, a thousand times, 
and there would still be more." 

"Are you saying that I--I mean we-could do it again?" Jonas asked. 
"I'd really like to. I think I could steer, by pulling the rope. I didn't try 
this time, because it was so new." 

The old man, laughing, shook his head. "Maybe another day, for a 
treat. But there's no time, really, just to play. I only wanted to begin 
by showing you how it works. 

"Now," he said, turning businesslike, "lie back down. I want to --" 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 87 of 182 



Jonas did. He was eager for whatever experience would come 
next. But he had, suddenly, so many questions. 

"Why don't we have snow, and sleds, and hills?" he asked. "And 
when did we, in the past? Did my parents have sleds when they 
were young? Did you?" 

The old man shrugged and gave a short laugh. "No," he told Jonas. 
"It's a very distant memory. That's why it was so exhausting-l had 
to tug it forward from many generations back. It was given to me 
when I was a new Receiver, and the previous Receiver had to pull 
it through a long time period, too." 

"But what happened to those things? Snow, and the rest of it?" 

"Climate Control. Snow made growing food difficult, limited the 
agricultural periods. And unpredictable 



84 



weather made transportation almost impossible at times. It wasn't a 
practical thing, so it became obsolete when we went to Sameness. 

"And hills, too," he added. "They made conveyance of goods 
unwieldy. Trucks; buses. Slowed them down. So--" He waved his 
hand, as if a gesture had caused hills to disappear. "Sameness," he 
concluded. 

Jonas frowned. "I wish we had those things, still. Just now and 
then." 

The old man smiled. "So do I," he said. "But that choice is not ours." 

"But sir," Jonas suggested, "since you have so much power--" 

The man corrected him. "Honor," he said firmly. "I have great 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 88 of 182 



honor. So will you. But you will find that that is not the same as 
power. 

"Lie quietly now. Since we've entered into the topic of climate, let 
me give you something else. And this time I'm not going to tell you 
the name of it, because I want to test the receiving. You should be 
able to perceive the name without being told. I gave away snow 
and sled and downhill and runners by telling them to you in 
advance." 

Without being instructed, Jonas closed his eyes again. He felt the 
hands on his back again. He waited. 

Now it came more quickly, the feelings. This time the hands didn't 
become cold, but instead began to feel warm on his body. They 
moistened a little. The warmth spread, extending across his 
shoulders, up his neck, onto the side of his face. He could feel it 
through his clothed parts, too: a pleasant, all-over sensation; and 
when he licked his lips this time, the air was hot and heavy. 



85 



He didn't move. There was no sled. His posture didn't change. He 
was simply alone someplace, out of doors, lying down, and the 
warmth came from far above. It was not as exciting as the ride 
through the snowy air; but it was pleasurable and comforting. 

Suddenly he perceived the word for it: sunshine. He perceived that 
it came from the sky. Then it ended. 

"Sunshine," he said aloud, opening his eyes. 

"Good. You did get the word. That makes my job easier. Not so 
much explaining." 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 89 of 182 



"And it came from the sky." "That's right," the old man said. "Just 
the way it used to. 

"Before Sameness. Before Climate Control," Jonas added. 

The man laughed. "You receive well, and learn quickly. I'm very 
pleased with you. That's enough for today, I think. We're off to a 
good start." 

There was a question bothering Jonas. "Sir," he said, "The Chief 
Elder told me-she told everyone--and you told me, too, that it 
would be painful. So I was a little scared. But it didn't hurt at all. I 
really enjoyed it." He looked quizzically at the old man. 

The man sighed. "I started you with memories of pleasure. My 
previous failure gave me the wisdom to do that." He took a few 
deep breaths. "Jonas," he said, "it will be painful. But it need not be 
painful yet." 

"I'm brave. I really am." Jonas sat up a little straighter. 

The old man looked at him for a moment. He smiled. 

"I can see that," he said. "Well, since you asked the 



86 



question-l think I have enough energy for one more transmission. 

"Lie down once more. This will be the last today." 

Jonas obeyed cheerfully. He dosed his eyes, waiting, and felt the 
hands again; then he felt the warmth again, the sunshine again, 
coming from the sky of this other consciousness that was so new to 
him. This time, as he lay basking in the wonderful warmth, he felt 
the passage of time. His real self was aware that it was only a 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 90 of 182 



minute or two; but his other, memory-receiving self felt hours pass 
in the sun. His skin began to sting. Restlessly he moved one arm, 
bending it, and felt a sharp pain in the crease of his inner arm at the 
elbow. 

"Ouch," he said loudly, and shifted on the bed. "Owwww," he said, 
wincing at the shift, and even moving his mouth to speak made his 
face hurt. 

He knew there was a word, but the pain kept him from grasping it. 

Then it ended. He opened his eyes, wincing with discomfort. "It 
hurt," he told the man, "and I couldn't get the word for it." 

"It was sunburn," the old man told him. 

"It hurt a lot," Jonas said, "but I'm glad you gave it to me. It was 
interesting. And now I understand better, what it meant, that there 
would be pain." 

The man didn't respond. He sat silently for a second. Finally he 
said, "Get up, now. It's time for you to go home." 

They both walked to the center of the room. Jonas put his tunic 
back on. "Goodbye, sir," he said. "Thank you for my first day." 



87 



The old man nodded to him. He looked drained, and a little sad. 

"Sir?" Jonas said shyly. 

"Yes? Do you have a question?" 

"It's just that I don't know your name. I thought you were The 
Receiver, but you say that now I'm The Receiver. So I don't know 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 91 of 182 



what to call you." 

The man had sat back down in the comfortable upholstered chair. 
He moved his shoulders around as if to ease away an aching 
sensation. He seemed terribly weary. 

"Call me The Giver," he told Jonas. 



88 



12 

"You slept soundly, Jonas?" his mother asked at the morning meal. 
"No dreams?" 

Jonas simply smiled and nodded, not ready to lie, not willing to tell 
the truth. "I slept very soundly," he said. 

"I wish this one would," his father said, leaning down from his chair 
to touch Gabriel's waving fist. The basket was on the floor beside 
him; in its corner, beside Gabriel's head, the smiled hippo sat 
staring with its blank eyes. 

"So do I," Mother said, rolling her eyes. "He's so fretful at night." 

Jonas had not heard the newchild during the night because as 
always, he had slept soundly. But it was not true that he had no 
dreams. 

Again and again, as he slept, he had slid down that snow-covered 
hill. Always, in the dream, it seemed as if there were a destination: 
a something- he could not grasp what-that lay beyond the place 
where the thickness of snow brought the sled to a stop. 

He was left, upon awakening, with the feeling that he wanted, even

The Giver

somehow needed, to reach the something that waited in the 
distance. The feeling that it was good. That it was welcoming. That 
it was significant. 



89 



But he did not know how to get there. 

He tried to shed the leftover dream, gathering his schoolwork and 
preparing for the day. 

School seemed a little different today. The classes were the same: 
language and communications; commerce and industry; science 
and technology; civil procedures and government. But during the 
breaks for recreation periods and the midday meal, the other new 
Twelves were abuzz with descriptions of their first day of training. 
All of them talked at once, interrupting each other, hastily making 
the required apology for interrupting, then forgetting again in the 
excitement of describing the new experiences. 

Jonas listened. He was very aware of his own admonition not to 
discuss his training. But it would have been impossible, anyway. 
There was no way to describe to his friends what he had 
experienced there in the Annex room. How could you describe a 
sled without describing a hill and snow; and how could you describe 
a hill and snow to someone who had never felt height or wind or 
that feathery, magical cold? 

Even trained for years as they all had been in precision of 
language, what words could you use which would give another the 
experience of sunshine? 

So it was easy for Jonas to be still and to listen. 

After school hours he rode again beside Fiona to the House of the

10/19/2010 



The Giver

Old. 



"I looked for you yesterday," she told him, "so we could ride home 
together. Your bike was still there, and I waited for a little while. But 
it was getting late, so I went on home." 

"I apologize for making you wait," Jonas said. 



90 



"I accept your apology," she replied automatically. 

"I stayed a little longer than I expected," Jonas explained. 

She pedaled forward silently, and he knew that she expected him to 
tell her why. She expected him to describe his first day of training. 
But to ask would have fallen into the category of rudeness. 

"You've been doing so many volunteer hours with the Old," Jonas 
said, changing the subject. "There won't be much that you don't 
already know." 

"Oh, there's lots to learn," Fiona replied. "There's administrative 
work, and the dietary rules, and punishment for disobedience-did 
you know that they use a discipline wand on the Old, the same as 
for small children? And there's occupational therapy, and 
recreational activities, and medications, and--" 

They reached the building and braked their bikes. 

"I really think I'll like it better than school," Fiona confessed. 

"Me too," Jonas agreed, wheeling his bike into its place. 

She waited for a second, as if, again, she expected him to go on. 
Then she looked at her watch, waved, and hurried toward the 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 94 of 182 



entrance. 

Jonas stood for a moment beside his bike, startled. It had 
happened again: the thing that he thought of now as "seeing 
beyond." This time it had been Fiona who had undergone that 
fleeting indescribable change. As he looked up and toward her 
going through the door, it happened; she changed. Actually, Jonas 
thought, trying to recreate it in his mind, it wasn't Fiona in her 
entirety. It 






91 



seemed to be just her hair. And just for that flickering instant. 

He ran through it in his mind. It was clearly beginning to happen 
more often. First, the apple a few weeks before. The next time had 
been the faces in the audience at the Auditorium, just two days 
ago. Now, today, Fiona's hair. 

Frowning, Jonas walked toward the Annex. I will ask the Giver, he 
decided. 

The old man looked up, smiling, when Jonas entered the room. He 
was already seated beside the bed, and he seemed more energetic 
today, slightly renewed, and glad to see Jonas. 

"Welcome," he said. "We must get started. You're one minute late." 

"I apologi-" Jonas began, and then stopped, flustered, 
remembering there were to be no apologies. 

He removed his tunic and went to the bed. "I'm one minute late 
because something happened," he explained. "And I'd like to ask 
you about it, if you don't mind." 

"You may ask me anything." 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 95 of 182 



Jonas tried to sort it out in his mind so that he could explain it 
clearly. "I think it's what you call seeing-beyond," he said. 

The Giver nodded. "Describe it," he said. 

Jonas told him about the experience with the apple. Then the 
moment on the stage, when he had looked out and seen the same 
phenomenon in the faces of the crowd. 

"Then today, just now, outside, it happened with my friend Fiona. 
She herself didn't change, exactly. But something about her 
changed for a second. Her hair looked different; but not in its 
shape, not in its length. I can't 



92 



quite- " Jonas paused, frustrated by his inability to grasp and 
describe exactly what had occurred. 

Finally he simply said, "It changed. I don't know how, or why." 

"That's why I was one minute late," he concluded, and looked 
questioningly at The Giver. 

To his surprise, the old man asked him a question which seemed 
unrelated to the seeing-beyond. "When I gave you the memory 
yesterday, the first one, the ride on the sled, did you look around?" 

Jonas nodded. "Yes," he said, "but the stuff- I mean the snow-in 
the air made it hard to see anything." 

"Did you look at the sled?" 

Jonas thought back. "No. I only felt it under me. I dreamed of it last 
night, too. But I don't remember seeing the sled in my dream, 
either. Just feeling it." 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 96 of 182 



The Giver seemed to be thinking. 

"When I was observing you, before the selection, I perceived that 
you probably had the capacity, and what you describe confirms 
that. It happened somewhat differently to me," The Giver told him. 
"When I was just your age-about to become the new Receiver--! 
began to experience it, though it took a different form. With me it 
was ... well, I won't describe that now; you wouldn't understand it 
yet. 

"But I think I can guess how it's happening with you. Let me just 
make a little test, to confirm my guess. Lie down." 

Jonas lay on the bed again with his hands at his sides. He felt 
comfortable here now. He dosed his eyes and waited for the 
familiar feel of The Giver's hands on his back. 



93 



But it didn't come. Instead, The Giver instructed him, "Call back the 
memory of the ride on the sled. Just the beginning of it, where 
you're at the top of the hill, before the slide starts. And this time, 
look down at the sled." 

Jonas was puzzled. He opened his eyes. "Excuse me," he asked 
politely, "but don't you have to give me the memory?" 

"It's your memory, now, It's not mine to experience any longer. I 
gave it away." 

"But how can I call it back?" 

"You can remember last year, or the year that you were a Seven, or 
a Five, can't you?" 

"Of course." 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 97 of 182 



"It's much the same. Everyone in the community has one- 
generation memories like those. But now you will be able to go 
back farther. Try. Just concentrate." 

Jonas closed his eyes again. He took a deep breath and sought the 
sled and the hill and the snow in his consciousness. 

There they were, with no effort. He was again sitting in that whirling 
world of snowflakes, atop the hill. 

Jonas grinned with delight, and blew his own steamy breath into 
view. Then, as he had been instructed, he looked down. He saw his 
own hands, furred again with snow, holding the rope. He saw his 
legs, and moved them aside for a glimpse of the sled beneath. 

Dumbfounded, he stared at it. This time it was not a fleeting 
impression. This time the sled had--and continued to have, as he 
blinked, and stared at it again-that same mysterious quality that 
the apple had had so briefly. And Fiona's hair. The sled did not 
change. It simply was-whatever the thing was. 



94 



Jonas opened his eyes and was still on the bed. The Giver was 
watching him curiously. 

"Yes," Jonas said slowly. "I saw it, in the sled." 

"Let me try one more thing. Look over there, to the bookcase. Do 
you see the very top row of books, the ones behind the table, on 
the top shelf?" 

Jonas sought them with his eyes. He stared at them, and they 
changed. But the change was fleeting. It slipped away the next 
instant. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 98 of 182 



"It happened," Jonas said. "It happened to the books, but it went 
away again." 

"I'm right, then," The Giver said. "You're beginning to see the color 
red." 

"The what?" 

The Giver sighed. "How to explain this? Once, back in the time of 
the memories, everything had a shape and size, the way things still 
do, but they also had a quality called color. 

"There were a lot of colors, and one of them was called red. That's 
the one you are starting to see. Your friend Fiona has red hair- 
quite distinctive, actually; I've noticed it before. When you 
mentioned Fiona's hair, it was the clue that told me you were 
probably beginning to see the color red." 

"And the faces of people? The ones I saw at the Ceremony?" 

The Giver shook his head. "No, flesh isn't red. But it has red tones 
in it. There was a time, actually-you'll see this in the memories 
later-when flesh was many different colors. That was before we 
went to Sameness. Today flesh is all the same, and what you saw 
was the red tones. 



95 



Probably when you saw the faces take on color it wasn't as deep or 
vibrant as the apple, or your friend's hair." 

The Giver chuckled, suddenly. "We've never completely mastered 
Sameness. I suppose the genetic scientists are still hard at work 
trying to work the kinks out. Hair like Fiona's must drive them 
crazy."

10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 99 of 182 



Jonas listened, trying hard to comprehend. "And the sled?" he said. 
"It had that same thing: the color red. But it didn't change, Giver. It 
just was." 

"Because it's a memory from the time when color was." 

"It was so-oh, I wish language were more precise! The red was so 
beautiful!" 

The Giver nodded. "It is." 

"Do you see it all the time?" 

"I see all of them. All the colors." 

"Will I?" 

"Of course. When you receive the memories. You have the capacity 
to see beyond. You'll gain wisdom, then, along with colors. And lots 
more." 

Jonas wasn't interested, just then, in wisdom. It was the colors that 
fascinated him. "Why can't everyone see them? Why did colors 
disappear?" 

The Giver shrugged. "Our people made that choice, the choice to 
go to Sameness. Before my time, before the previous time, back 
and back and back. We relinquished color when we relinquished 
sunshine and did away with differences." He thought for a moment. 
"We gained control of many things. But we had to let go of others." 

"We shouldn't have!" Jonas said fiercely. 

The Giver looked startled at the certainty of Jonas's reaction. Then 
he smiled wryly. "You've come very quickly 



file://C :\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 1 0/1 9/20 10 



The Giver 



Page 100 of 182 



96 



to that conclusion," he said. "It took me many years. Maybe your 
wisdom will come much more quickly than mine." 

He glanced at the wall clock. "Lie back down, now. We have so 
much to do." 

"Giver," Jonas asked as he arranged himself again on the bed, 
"how did it happen to you when you were becoming The Receiver? 
You said that the seeing-beyond happened to you, but not the 
same way." 

The hands came to his back. "Another day," The Giver said gently. 
"I'll tell you another day. Now we must work. And I've thought of a 
way to help you with the concept of color. 

"Close your eyes and be still, now. I'm going to give you a memory 
of a rainbow." 



97 



13 

Days went by, and weeks. Jonas learned, through the memories, 
the names of colors; and now he began to see them all, in his 
ordinary life (though he knew it was ordinary no longer, and would 
never be again). But they didn't last. There would be a glimpse of 
green-the landscaped lawn around the Central Plaza; a bush on 
the riverbank. The bright orange of pumpkins being trucked in from 
the agricultural fields beyond the community boundary-seen in an 
instant, the flash of brilliant color, but gone again, returning to their 
flat and hueless shade. 

The Giver told him that it would be a very long time before he had 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 101 of 182 



the colors to keep. 

"But I want them!" Jonas said angrily. "It isn't fair that nothing has 
color!" 

"Not fair?" The Giver looked at Jonas curiously. "Explain what you 
mean." 

"Well ... "Jonas had to stop and think it through. "If everything's the 
same, then there aren't any choices! I want to wake up in the 
morning and decide things! A blue tunic, or a red one?" 

He looked down at himself, at the colorless fabric of his clothing. 
"But it's all the same, always." 



98 



Then he laughed a little. "I know it's not important, what you wear. It 
doesn't matter. But--" 

"It's the choosing that's important, isn't it?" The Giver asked him. 

Jonas nodded. "My little brother--" he began, and then corrected 
himself. "No, that's inaccurate. He's not my brother, not really. But 
this newchild that my family takes care of-- his name's Gabriel?" 

"Yes, I know about Gabriel." 

"Well, he's right at the age where he's learning so much. He grabs 
toys when we hold them in front of him-my father says he's 
learning small-muscle control. And he's really cute." 

The Giver nodded. 

"But now that I can see colors, at least sometimes, I was just 
thinking: what if we could hold up things that were bright red, or 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 102 of 182 



bright yellow, and he could choose? Instead of the Sameness." 

"He might make wrong choices." 

"Oh." Jonas was silent for a minute. "Oh, I see what you mean. It 
wouldn't matter for a newchild's toy. But later it does matter, doesn't 
it? We don't dare to let people make choices of their own." 

"Not safe?" The Giver suggested. 

"Definitely not safe," Jonas said with certainty. "What if they were 
allowed to choose their own mate? And chose wrong? 

"Or what if," he went on, almost laughing at the absurdity, "they 
chose their own jobs?" 

"Frightening, isn't it?" The Giver said. 

Jonas chuckled. "Very frightening. I can't even imagine it. We really 
have to protect people from wrong choices." 



99 



"It's safer." 

"Yes," Jonas agreed. "Much safer." 

But when the conversation turned to other things, Jonas was left, 
still, with a feeling of frustration that he didn't understand. 

He found that he was often angry, now: irrationally angry at his 
groupmates, that they were satisfied with their lives which had none 
of the vibrance his own was taking on. And he was angry at 
himself, that he could not change that for them. 

He tried. Without asking permission from The Giver, because he 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 103 of 182 



feared-or knew-that it would be denied, he tried to give his new 
awareness to his friends. 

"Asher," Jonas said one morning, "look at those flowers very 
carefully." They were standing beside a bed of geraniums planted 
near the Hall of Open Records. He put his hands on Asher's 
shoulders, and concentrated on the red of the petals, trying to hold 
it as long as he could, and trying at the same time to transmit the 
awareness of red to his friend. 

"What's the matter?" Asher asked uneasily. "Is something wrong?" 
He moved away from Jonas's hands. It was extremely rude for one 
citizen to touch another outside of family units. 

"No, nothing. I thought for a minute that they were wilting, and we 
should let the Gardening Crew know they needed more watering." 
Jonas sighed, and turned away. 

One evening he came home from his training weighted with new 
knowledge. The Giver had chosen a startling and disturbing 
memory that day. Under the touch of his hands, Jonas had found 
himself suddenly in a place that was completely alien: hot and 
windswept under a vast 



100 



blue sky. There were tufts of sparse grass, a few bushes and rocks, 
and nearby he could see an area of thicker vegetation: broad, low 
trees outlined against the sky. He could hear noises: the sharp 
crack of weapons-he perceived the word guns-- and then shouts, 
and an immense crashing thud as something fell, tearing branches 
from the trees. 

He heard voices calling to one another. Peering from the place 
where he stood hidden behind some shrubbery, he was reminded 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 104 of 182 



of what The Giver had told him, that there had been a time when 
flesh had different colors. Two of these men had dark brown skin; 
the others were light. Going closer, he watched them hack the 
tusks from a motionless elephant on the ground and haul them 
away, spattered with blood. He felt himself overwhelmed with a new 
perception of the color he knew as red. 

Then the men were gone, speeding toward the horizon in a vehicle 
that spit pebbles from its whirling tires. One hit his forehead and 
stung him there. But the memory continued, though Jonas ached 
now for it to end. 

Now he saw another elephant emerge from the place where it had 
stood hidden in the trees. Very slowly it walked to the mutilated 
body and looked down. With its sinuous trunk it stroked the huge 
corpse; then it reached up, broke some leafy branches with a snap, 
and draped them over the mass of torn thick flesh. 

Finally it tilted its massive head, raised its trunk, and roared into the 
empty landscape. Jonas had never heard such a sound. It was a 
sound of rage and grief and it seemed never to end. 

He could still hear it when he opened his eyes and lay anguished 
on the bed where he received the memories. 



101 



It continued to roar into his consciousness as he pedaled slowly 
home. 

"Lily," he asked that evening when his sister took her comfort 
object, the stuffed elephant, from the shelf, "did you know that once 
there really were elephants? Live ones?" 

She glanced down at the ragged comfort object and grinned. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 105 of 182 



"Right," she said, skeptically. "Sure, Jonas." 

Jonas went and sat beside them while his father untied Lily's hair 
ribbons and combed her hair. He placed one hand on each of their 
shoulders. With all of his being he tried to give each of them a piece 
of the memory: not of the tortured cry of the elephant, but of the 
being of the elephant, of the towering, immense creature and the 
meticulous touch with which it had tended its friend at the end. 

But his father had continued to comb Lily's long hair, and Lily, 
impatient, had finally wiggled under her brother's touch. "Jonas," 
she said, "you're hurting me with your hand." 

"I apologize for hurting you, Lily," Jonas mumbled, and took his 
hand away. 

" 'Ccept your apology," Lily responded indifferently, stroking the 
lifeless elephant. 

"Giver," Jonas asked once, as they prepared for the day's work, 
"don't you have a spouse? Aren't you allowed to apply for one?" 
Although he was exempted from the rules against rudeness, he 
was aware that this was a rude question. But The Giver had 
encouraged all of his questions, not seeming to be embarrassed or 
offended by even the most personal. 

The Giver chuckled. "No, there's no rule against it. 



102 



And I did have a spouse. You're forgetting how old I am, Jonas. My 
former spouse lives now with the Childless Adults." 

"Oh, of course." Jonas had forgotten The Giver's obvious age. 
When adults of the community became older, their lives became 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 106 of 182 



different. They were no longer needed to create family units. 
Jonas's own parents, when he and Lily were grown, would go to 
live with the Childless Adults. 

"You'll be able to apply for a spouse, Jonas, if you want to. I'll warn 
you, though, that it will be difficult. Your living arrangements will 
have to be different from those of most family units, because the 
books are forbidden to citizens. You and I are the only ones with 
access to the books." 

Jonas glanced around at the astonishing array of volumes. From 
time to time, now, he could see their colors. With their hours 
together, his and The Giver's, consumed by conversation and by 
the transmission of memories, Jonas had not yet opened any of the 
books. But he read the titles here and there, and knew that they 
contained all of the knowledge of centuries, and that one day they 
would belong to him. 

"So if I have a spouse, and maybe children, I will have to hide the 
books from them?" 

The Giver nodded. "I wasn't permitted to share the books with my 
spouse, that's correct. And there are other difficulties, too. You 
remember the rule that says the new Receiver can't talk about his 
training?" 

Jonas nodded. Of course he remembered. It had turned out, by far, 
to be the most frustrating of the rules he was required to obey. 



103 



"When you become the official Receiver, when we're finished here, 
you'll be given a whole new set of rules. Those are the rules that I 
obey. And it won't surprise you that I am forbidden to talk about my 
work to anyone except the new Receiver. That's you, of course. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 107 of 182 



"So there will be a whole part of your life which you won't be able to 
share with a family. It's hard, Jonas. It was hard for me. 

"You do understand, don't you, that this is my life? The memories?" 

Jonas nodded again, but he was puzzled. Didn't life consist of the 
things you did each day? There wasn't anything else, really. "I've 
seen you taking walks," he said. 

The Giver sighed. "I walk. I eat at mealtime. And when I am called 
by the Committee of Elders, I appear before them, to give them 
counsel and advice." 

"Do you advise them often?" Jonas was a little frightened at the 
thought that one day he would be the one to advise the ruling body. 

But the Giver said no. "Rarely. Only when they are faced with 
something that they have not experienced before. Then they call 
upon me to use the memories and advise them. But it very seldom 
happens. Sometimes I wish they'd ask for my wisdom more often- 
there are so many things I could tell them; things I wish they would 
change. But they don't want change. Life here is so orderly, so 
predictable-so painless. It's what they've chosen." 

"I don't know why they even need a Receiver, then, if they never 
call upon him," Jonas commented. 

"They need me. And you," The Giver said, but didn't explain. "They 
were reminded of that ten years ago." 



104 



"What happened ten years ago?" Jonas asked. "Oh, I know. You 
tried to train a successor and it failed. Why? Why did that remind 
them?" 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 108 of 182 



The Giver smiled grimly. "When the new Receiver failed, the 
memories that she had received were released. They didn't come 
back to me. They went ..." 

He paused, and seemed to be struggling with the concept. "I don't 
know, exactly. They went to the place where memories once 
existed before Receivers were created. Someplace out there--" He 
gestured vaguely with his arm. "And then the people had access to 
them. Apparently that's the way it was, once. Everyone had access 
to memories. 

"It was chaos," he said. "They really suffered for a while. Finally it 
subsided as the memories were assimilated. But it certainly made 
them aware of how they need a Receiver to contain all that pain. 
And knowledge." 

"But you have to suffer like that all the time," Jonas pointed out. 

The Giver nodded. "And you will. It's my life. It will be yours." 

Jonas thought about it, about what it would be like for him. "Along 
with walking and eating and--" He looked around the walls of books. 
"Reading? That's it?" 

The Giver shook his head. "Those are simply the things that I do. 
My life is here." 

"In this room?" 

The Giver shook his head. He put his hands to his own face, to his 
chest. "No. Here, in my being. Where the memories are." 

"My Instructors in science and technology have taught 



105 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 109 of 182 



us about how the brain works," Jonas told him eagerly. "It's full of 
electrical impulses. It's like a computer. If you stimulate one part of 
the brain with an electrode, it--" He stopped talking. He could see 
an odd look on The Giver's face. 

"They know nothing," The Giver said bitterly. 

Jonas was shocked. Since the first day in the Annex room, they 
had together disregarded the rules about rudeness, and Jonas felt 
comfortable with that now. But this was different, and far beyond 
rude. This was a terrible accusation. What if someone had heard? 

He glanced quickly at the wall speaker, terrified that the Committee 
might be listening as they could at any time. But, as always during 
their sessions together, the switch had been turned to OFF. 

"Nothing?" Jonas whispered nervously. "But my instructors-" 

The Giver flicked his hand as if brushing something aside. "Oh, 
your instructors are well trained. They know their scientific facts. 
Everyone is well trained for his job. 

"It's just that ... without the memories it's all meaningless. They 
gave that burden to me. And to the previous Receiver. And the one 
before him." 

"And back and back and back," Jonas said, knowing the phrase 
that always came. 

The Giver smiled, though his smile was oddly harsh. "That's right. 
And next it will be you. A great honor." 

"Yes, sir. They told me that at the Ceremony. The very highest 
honor." 

Some afternoons The Giver sent him away without training. Jonas

The Giver 



Page 110 of 182 



knew, on days when he arrived to find The 



106 



Giver hunched over, rocking his body slightly back and forth, his 
face pale, that he would be sent away. 

"Go," The Giver would tell him tensely. "I'm in pain today. Come 
back tomorrow." 

On those days, worried and disappointed, Jonas would walk alone 
beside the river. The paths were empty of people except for the few 
Delivery Crews and Landscape Workers here and there. Small 
children were all at the Childcare Center after school, and the older 
ones busy with volunteer hours or training. 

By himself, he tested his own developing memory. He watched the 
landscape for glimpses of the green that he knew was embedded in 
the shrubbery; when it came flickering into his consciousness, he 
focused upon it, keeping it there, darkening it, holding it in his vision 
as long as possible until his head hurt and he let it fade away. 

He stared at the flat, colorless sky, bringing blue from it, and 
remembered sunshine until finally, for an instant, he could feel 
warmth. 

He stood at the foot of the bridge that spanned the river, the bridge 
that citizens were allowed to cross only on official business. Jonas 
had crossed it on school trips, visiting the outlying communities, 
and he knew that the land beyond the bridge was much the same, 
flat and well ordered, with fields for agriculture. The other 
communities he had seen on visits were essentially the same as his 
own, the only differences were slightly altered styles of dwellings, 
slightly different schedules in the schools.

The Giver

He wondered what lay in the far distance where he had never gone. 
The land didn't end beyond those nearby communities. Were there 
hills Elsewhere? Were there vast 



107 



wind-torn areas like the place he had seen in memory, the place 
where the elephant died? 

"Giver," he asked one afternoon following a day when he had been 
sent away, "what causes you pain?" 

When the Giver was silent, Jonas continued. "The Chief Elder told 
me, at the beginning, that the receiving of memory causes terrible 
pain. And you described for me that the failure of the last new 
Receiver released painful memories to the community. 

"But I haven't suffered, Giver. Not really." Jonas smiled. "Oh, I 
remember the sunburn you gave me on the very first day. But that 
wasn't so terrible. What is it that makes you suffer so much? If you 
gave some of it to me, maybe your pain would be less." 

The Giver nodded. "Lie down," he said. "It's time, I suppose. I can't 
shield you forever. You'll have to take it all on eventually. 

"Let me think," he went on, when Jonas was on the bed, waiting, a 
little fearful. 



"All right," The Giver said after a moment, "I've decided. We'll start 
with something familiar. Let's go once again to a hill, and a sled." 

He placed his hands on Jonas's back. 



108

It was much the same, this memory, though the hill seemed to be a 
different one, steeper, and the snow was not falling as thickly as it 
had before. 

It was colder, also, Jonas perceived. He could see, as he sat 
waiting at the top of the hill, that the snow beneath the sled was not 
thick and soft as it had been before, but hard, and coated with 
bluish ice. 

The sled moved forward, and Jonas grinned with delight, looking 
forward to the breathtaking slide down through the invigorating air. 

But the runners, this time, couldn't slice through the frozen expanse 
as they had on the other, snow-cushioned hill. They skittered 
sideways and the sled gathered speed. Jonas pulled at the rope, 
trying to steer, but the steepness and speed took control from his 
hands and he was no longer enjoying the feeling of freedom but 
instead, terrified, was at the mercy of the wild acceleration 
downward over the ice. 

Sideways, spinning, the sled hit a bump in the hill and Jonas was 
jarred loose and thrown violently into the air. He fell with his leg 
twisted under him, and could hear the crack of bone. His face 
scraped along jagged edges of ice 



109 



and when he came, at last, to a stop, he lay shocked and still, 
feeling nothing at first but fear. 

Then, the first wave of pain. He gasped. It was as if a hatchet lay 
lodged in his leg, slicing through each nerve with a hot blade. In his 
agony he perceived the word "fire" and felt flames licking at the torn 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 113 of 182 



bone and flesh. 

He tried to move, and could not. The pain grew. 

He screamed. There was no answer. 

Sobbing, he turned his head and vomited onto the frozen snow. 
Blood dripped from his face into the vomit. 

"Nooooo!" he cried, and the sound disappeared into the empty 
landscape, into the wind. 

Then, suddenly, he was in the Annex room again, writhing on the 
bed. His face was wet with tears. 

Able to move now, he rocked his own body back and forth, 
breathing deeply to release the remembered pain. 

He sat, and looked at his own leg, where it lay straight on the bed, 
unbroken. The brutal slice of pain was gone. But the leg ached 
horribly, still, and his face felt raw. 

"May I have relief-of-pain, please?" he begged. It was always 
provided in his everyday life for the bruises and wounds, for a 
mashed finger, a stomach ache, a skinned knee from a fall from a 
bike. There was always a daub of anesthetic ointment, or a pill; or 
in severe instances, an injection that brought complete and 
instantaneous deliverance. 

But The Giver said no, and looked away. 

Limping, Jonas walked home, pushing his bicycle, that evening. 
The sunburn pain had been so small, in comparison, and had not 
stayed with him. But this ache lingered. 



110

The Giver Page 114 of 182 



It was not unendurable, as the pain on the hill had been. Jonas 
tried to be brave. He remembered that the Chief Elder had said he 
was brave. 

"Is something wrong, Jonas?" his father asked at the evening meal. 
"You're so quiet tonight. Aren't you feeling well? Would you like 
some medication?" 

But Jonas remembered the rules. No medication for anything 
related to his training. 

And no discussion of his training. At the time for sharing-of-feelings, 
he simply said that he felt tired, that his school lessons had been 
unusually demanding that day. 

He went to his sleepingroom early, and from behind the closed door 
he could hear his parents and sister laughing as they gave Gabriel 
his evening bath. 

They have never known pain, he thought. The realization made him 
feel desperately lonely, and he rubbed his throbbing leg. He 
eventually slept. Again and again he dreamed of the anguish and 
the isolation on the forsaken hill. 

The daily training continued, and now it always included pain. The 
agony of the fractured leg began to seem no more than a mild 
discomfort as The Giver led Jonas firmly, little by little, into the deep 
and terrible suffering of the past. Each time, in his kindness, The 
Giver ended the afternoon with a color-filled memory of pleasure: a 
brisk sail on a blue-green lake; a meadow dotted with yellow 
wildflowers; an orange sunset behind mountains. 

It was not enough to assuage the pain that Jonas was beginning, 
now, to know.

The Giver 



Page 115 of 182 



"Why?" Jonas asked him after he had received a torturous memory 
in which he had been neglected and unfed; 



111 



the hunger had caused excruciating spasms in his empty, 
distended stomach. He lay on the bed, aching. "Why do you and I 
have to hold these memories?" 

"It gives us wisdom," The Giver replied. "Without wisdom I could not 
fulfill my function of advising the Committee of Elders when they 
call upon me." 

"But what wisdom do you get from hunger?" Jonas groaned. His 
stomach still hurt, though the memory had ended. 

"Some years ago," The Giver told him, "before your birth, a lot of 
citizens petitioned the Committee of Elders. They wanted to 
increase the rate of births. They wanted each Birthmother to be 
assigned four births instead of three, so that the population would 
increase and there would be more Laborers available." 

Jonas nodded, listening. "That makes sense." 

"The idea was that certain family units could accommodate an 
additional child." 

Jonas nodded again. "Mine could," he pointed out. "We have 
Gabriel this year, and it's fun, having a third child." 

"The Committee of Elders sought my advice," The Giver said. "It 
made sense to them, too, but it was a new idea, and they came to 
me for wisdom." 

"And you used your memories?" 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 116 of 182 



The Giver said yes. "And the strongest memory that came was 
hunger. It came from many generations back. Centuries back. The 
population had gotten so big that hunger was everywhere. 
Excruciating hunger and starvation. It was followed by warfare." 

Warfare? It was a concept Jonas did not know. But hunger was 
familiar to him now. Unconsciously he rubbed 






112 



his own abdomen, recalling the pain of its unfulfilled needs. "So you 
described that to them?" 

"They don't want to hear about pain. They just seek the advice. I 
simply advised them against increasing the population." 

"But you said that that was before my birth. They hardly ever come 
to you for advice. Only when they-what was it you said? When 
they have a problem they've never faced before. When did it 
happen last?" 

"Do you remember the day when the plane flew over the 
community?" 

"Yes. I was scared." 

"So were they. They prepared to shoot it down. But they sought my 
advice. I told them to wait." 

"But how did you know? How did you know the pilot was lost?" 

"I didn't. I used my wisdom, from the memories. I knew that there 
had been times in the past-terrible times-when people had 
destroyed others in haste, in fear, and had brought about their own 
destruction." 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 117 of 182 



Jonas realized something. "That means," he said slowly, "that you 
have memories of destruction. And you have to give them to me, 
too, because I have to get the wisdom." 

The Giver nodded. 

"But it will hurt," Jonas said. It wasn't a question. "It will hurt 
terribly," The Giver agreed. 

"But why can't everyone have the memories? I think it would seem 
a little easier if the memories were shared. You and I wouldn't have 
to bear so much by ourselves, if everybody took a part." 



113 



The Giver sighed. "You're right," he said. "But then everyone would 
be burdened and pained. They don't want that. And that's the real 
reason The Receiver is so vital to them, and so honored. They 
selected me--and you-to lift that burden from themselves." 

"When did they decide that?" Jonas asked angrily. "It wasn't fair. 
Let's change it!" 

"How do you suggest we do that? I've never been able to think of a 
way, and I'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom." 

"But there are two of us now," Jonas said eagerly. "Together we 
can think of something!" 

The Giver watched him with a wry smile. 

"Why can't we just apply for a change of rules?" Jonas suggested. 

The Giver laughed; then Jonas, too, chuckled reluctantly. 

"The decision was made long before my time or yours," The Giver 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 118 of 182 



said, "and before the previous Receiver, and--" He waited. 

"Back and back and back." Jonas repeated the familiar phrase. 
Sometimes it had seemed humorous to him. Sometimes it had 
seemed meaningful and important. 

Now it was ominous. It meant, he knew, that nothing could be 
changed. 

The newchild, Gabriel, was growing, and successfully passed the 
tests of maturity that the Nurturers gave each month; he could sit 
alone, now, could reach for and grasp small play objects, and he 
had six teeth. During the daytime hours, Father reported, he was 
cheerful and seemed 



114 



of normal intelligence. But he remained fretful at night, whimpering 
often, needing frequent attention. 

"After all this extra time I've put in with him," Father said one 
evening after Gabriel had been bathed and was lying, for the 
moment, hugging his hippo placidly in the small crib that had 
replaced the basket, "I hope they're not going to decide to release 
him." 

"Maybe it would be for the best," Mother suggested. "I know you 
don't mind getting up with him at night. But the lack of sleep is 
awfully hard for me." 

"If they release Gabriel, can we get another newchild as a visitor?" 
asked Lily. She was kneeling beside the crib, making funny faces at 
the little one, who was smiling back at her. 

Jonas's mother rolled her eyes in dismay. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 119 of 182 



"No," Father said, smiling. He ruffled Lily's hair. "It's very rare, 
anyway, that a newchild's status is as uncertain as Gabriel's. It 
probably won't happen again, for a long time. 

"Anyway," he sighed, "they won't make the decision for a while. 
Right now we're all preparing for a release we'll probably have to 
make very soon. There's a Birthmother who's expecting twin males 
next month." 

"Oh, dear," Mother said, shaking her head. "If they're identical, I 
hope you're not the one assigned--" 

"I am. I'm next on the list. I'll have to select the one to be nurtured, 
and the one to be released. It's usually not hard, though. Usually it's 
just a matter of birthweight. We release the smaller of the two." 

Jonas, listening, thought suddenly about the bridge and how, 
standing there, he had wondered what lay Elsewhere. 



115 



Was there someone there, waiting, who would receive the tiny 
released twin? Would it grow up Elsewhere, not knowing, ever, that 
in this community lived a being who looked exactly the same? 

For a moment he felt a tiny, fluttering hope that he knew was quite 
foolish. He hoped that it would be Larissa, waiting. Larissa, the old 
woman he had bathed. He remembered her sparkling eyes, her soft 
voice, her low chuckle. Fiona had told him recently that Larissa had 
been released at a wonderful ceremony. 

But he knew that the Old were not given children to raise. Larissa's 
life Elsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the Old; she 
would not welcome the responsibility of nurturing a newchild who 
needed feeding and care, and would likely cry at night.

10/19/2010

Page 120 of 182 



"Mother? Father?" he said, the idea coming to him unexpectedly, 
"why don't we put Gabriel's crib in my room tonight? I know how to 
feed and comfort him, and it would let you and Father get some 
sleep." 

Father looked doubtful. "You sleep so soundly, Jonas. What if his 
restlessness didn't wake you?" 

It was Lily who answered that. "If no one goes to tend Gabriel," she 
pointed out, "he gets very loud. He'd wake all of us, if Jonas slept 
through it." 

Father laughed. "You're right, Lily-billy. All right, Jonas, let's try it, 
just for tonight. I'll take the night off and we'll let Mother get some 
sleep, too." 

Gabriel slept soundly for the earliest part of the night. Jonas, in his 
bed, lay awake for a while; from time to time he raised himself on 
one elbow, looking over at the crib. 



116 



The newchild was on his stomach, his arms relaxed beside his 
head, his eyes closed, and his breathing regular and 
undisturbed. Finally Jonas slept too. 

Then, as the middle hours of the night approached, the noise of 
Gabe's restlessness woke Jonas. The newchild was turning under 
his cover, flailing his arms, and beginning to whimper. 

Jonas rose and went to him. Gently he patted Gabriel's back. 
Sometimes that was all it took to lull him back to sleep. But the 
newchild still squirmed fretfully under his hand. 

Still patting rhythmically, Jonas began to remember the wonderful 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 121 of 182 



sail that The Giver had given him not long before: a bright, breezy 
day on a clear turquoise lake, and above him the white sail of the 
boat billowing as he moved along in the brisk wind. 

He was not aware of giving the memory; but suddenly he realized 
that it was becoming dimmer, that it was sliding through his hand 
into the being of the newchild. Gabriel became quiet. Startled, 
Jonas pulled back what was left of the memory with a burst of will. 
He removed his hand from the little back and stood quietly beside 
the crib. 

To himself, he called the memory of the sail forward again. It was 
still there, but the sky was less blue, the gentle motion of the boat 
slower, the water of the lake more murky and clouded. He kept it for 
a while, soothing his own nervousness at what had occurred, then 
let it go and returned to his bed. 

Once more, toward dawn, the newchild woke and cried out. Again 
Jonas went to him. This time he quite deliberately placed his hand 
firmly on Gabriel's back, and 



117 



released the rest of the calming day on the lake. Again Gabriel 
slept. 

But now Jonas lay awake, thinking. He no longer had any more 
than a wisp of the memory, and he felt a small lack where it had 
been. He could ask The Giver for another sail, he knew. A sail 
perhaps on ocean, next time, for Jonas had a memory of ocean, 
now, and knew what it was; he knew that there were sailboats 
there, too, in memories yet to be acquired. 

He wondered, though, if he should confess to The Giver that he 
had given a memory away. He was not yet qualified to be a Giver 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 122 of 182 



himself; nor had Gabriel been selected to be a Receiver. 



That he had this power frightened him. He decided not to tell. 



118 



15 

Jonas entered the Annex room and realized immediately that it was 
a day when he would be sent away. The Giver was rigid in his 
chair, his face in his hands. 

"I'll come back tomorrow, sir," he said quickly. Then he hesitated. 
"Unless maybe there's something I can do to help." 

The Giver looked up at him, his face contorted with suffering. 
"Please," he gasped, "take some of the pain." 

Jonas helped him to his chair at the side of the bed. Then he 
quickly removed his tunic and lay face down. "Put your hands on 
me," he directed, aware that in such anguish The Giver might need 
reminding. 

The hands came, and the pain came with them and through them. 
Jonas braced himself and entered the memory which was torturing 
The Giver. 

He was in a confused, noisy, foul-smelling place. It was daylight, 
early morning, and the air was thick with smoke that hung, yellow 
and brown, above the ground. Around him, everywhere, far across 
the expanse of what seemed to be a field, lay groaning men. A 
wild-eyed horse, its bridle torn and dangling, trotted frantically 
through the mounds of men, tossing its head, whinnying in panic. It 
stumbled, finally, then fell, and did not rise. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 123 of 182 



119 



Jonas heard a voice next to him. "Water," the voice said in a 
parched, croaking whisper. 

He turned his head toward the voice and looked into the half-closed 
eyes of a boy who seemed not much older than himself. Dirt 
streaked the boy's face and his matted blond hair. He lay sprawled, 
his gray uniform glistening with wet, fresh blood. 

The colors of the carnage were grotesquely bright: the crimson 
wetness on the rough and dusty fabric, the ripped shreds of grass, 
startlingly green, in the boy's yellow hair. 

The boy stared at him. "Water," he begged again. When he spoke, 
a new spurt of blood drenched the coarse cloth across his chest 
and sleeve. 

One of Jonas's arms was immobilized with pain, and he could see 
through his own torn sleeve something that looked like ragged flesh 
and splintery bone. He tried his remaining arm and felt it move. 
Slowly he reached to his side, felt the metal container there, and 
removed its cap, stopping the small motion of his hand now and 
then to wait for the surging pain to ease. Finally, when the container 
was open, he extended his arm slowly across the blood-soaked 
earth, inch by inch, and held it to the lips of the boy. Water trickled 
into the imploring mouth and down the grimy chin. 

The boy sighed. His head fell back, his lower jaw dropping as if he 
had been surprised by something. A dull blankness slid slowly 
across his eyes. He was silent. 

But the noise continued all around: the cries of the wounded men, 
the cries begging for water and for Mother and for death. Horses 
lying on the ground shrieked, raised their heads, and stabbed 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver

randomly toward the sky with their hooves. 



120 



From the distance, Jonas could hear the thud of cannons. 
Overwhelmed by pain, he lay there in the fearsome stench for 
hours, listened to the men and animals die, and learned what 
warfare meant. 

Finally, when he knew that he could bear it no longer and would 
welcome death himself, he opened his eyes and was once again on 
the bed. 



The Giver looked away, as if he could not bear to see what he had 
done to Jonas. "Forgive me," he said. 



121 



16 

Jonas did not want to go back. He didn't want the memories, didn't 
want the honor, didn't want the wisdom, didn't want the pain. He 
wanted his childhood again, his scraped knees and ball games. He 
sat in his dwelling alone, watching through the window, seeing 
children at play, citizens bicycling home from uneventful days at 
work, ordinary lives free of anguish because he had been selected, 
as others before him had, to bear their burden. 

But the choice was not his. He returned each day to the Annex 
room. 

The Giver was gentle with him for many days following the terrible 
shared memory of war. 

"There are so many good memories," The Giver reminded Jonas. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 125 of 182 



And it was true. By now Jonas had experienced countless bits of 
happiness, things he had never known of before. 

He had seen a birthday parry, with one child singled out and 
celebrated on his day, so that now he understood the joy of being 
an individual, special and unique and proud. 

He had visited museums and seen paintings filled with all the colors 
he could now recognize and name. 



122 



In one ecstatic memory he had ridden a gleaming brown horse 
across a field that smelled of damp grass, and had dismounted 
beside a small stream from which both he and the horse drank 
cold, clear water. Now he understood about animals; and in the 
moment that the horse turned from the stream and nudged Jonas's 
shoulder affectionately with its head, he perceived the bonds 
between animal and human. 

He had walked through woods, and sat at night beside a campfire. 
Although he had through the memories learned about the pain of 
loss and loneliness, now he gained, too, an understanding of 
solitude and its joy. 

"What is your favorite?" Jonas asked The Giver. "You don't have to 
give it away yet," he added quickly. "Just tell me about it, so I can 
look forward to it, because I'll have to receive it when your job is 
done." 

The Giver smiled. "Lie down," he said. "I'm happy to give it to you." 

Jonas felt the joy of it as soon as the memory began. Sometimes it 
took a while for him to get his bearings, to find his place. But this 
time he fit right in and felt the happiness that pervaded the memory.

He was in a room filled with people, and it was warm, with firelight 
glowing on a hearth. He could see through a window that outside it 
was night, and snowing. There were colored lights: red and green 
and yellow, twinkling from a tree which was, oddly, inside the room. 
On a table, lighted candles stood in a polished golden holder and 
cast a soft, flickering glow. He could smell things cooking, and he 
heard soft laughter. A golden-haired dog lay sleeping on the floor. 



123 



On the floor there were packages wrapped in brightly colored paper 
and tied with gleaming ribbons. As Jonas watched, a small child 
began to pick up the packages and pass them around the room: to 
other children, to adults who were obviously parents, and to an 
older, quiet couple, man and woman, who sat smiling together on a 
couch. 

While Jonas watched, the people began one by one to untie the 
ribbons on the packages, to unwrap the bright papers, open the 
boxes and reveal toys and clothing and books. There were cries of 
delight. They hugged one another. 

The small child went and sat on the lap of the old woman, and she 
rocked him and rubbed her cheek against his. 

Jonas opened his eyes and lay contentedly on the bed, still 
luxuriating in the warm and comforting memory. It had all been 
there, all the things he had learned to treasure. 

"What did you perceive?" The Giver asked. "Warmth," Jonas 
replied, "and happiness. And--let me think. Family. That it was a 
celebration of some sort, a holiday. And something else-l can't 
quite get the word for it." 

"It will come to you."

"Who were the old people? Why were they there?" It had puzzled 
Jonas, seeing them in the room. The Old of the community did not 
ever leave their special place, the House of the Old, where they 
were so well cared for and respected. 

"They were called Grandparents." 



124 



"Grand parents?" 

"Grandparents. It meant parents-of-the-parents, long ago." 

"Back and back and back?" Jonas began to laugh. "So actually, 
there could be parents-of-the-parents-of-the-parents-of-the 
parents?" 

The Giver laughed, too. "That's right. It's a little like looking at 
yourself looking in a mirror looking at yourself looking in a mirror." 

Jonas frowned. "But my parents must have had parents! I never 
thought about it before. Who are my parents-of-the-parents? Where 
are they?" 

"You could go look in the Hall of Open Records. You'd find the 
names. But think, son. If you apply for children, then who will be 
their parents-of-the-parents? Who will be their grandparents?" 

"My mother and father, of course." 

"And where will they be?" 

Jonas thought. "Oh," he said slowly. "When I finish my training and 
become a full adult, I'll be given my own dwelling. And then when 
Lily does, a few years later, she'll get her own dwelling, and maybe 
a spouse, and children if she applies for them, and then Mother and

Father--" 

"That's right." 

"As long as they're still working and contributing to the community, 
they'll go and live with the other Childless Adults. And they won't be 
part of my life anymore. 

"And after that, when the time comes, they'll go to the House of the 
Old," Jonas went on. He was thinking aloud. "And they'll be well 
cared for, and respected, and when they're released, there will be a 
celebration."

"Which you won't attend," The Giver pointed out. 

"No, of course not, because I won't even know about it. By then I'll 
be so busy with my own life. And Lily will, too. So our children, if we 
have them, won't know who their parents-of-parents are, either. 

"It seems to work pretty well that way, doesn't it? The way we do it 
in our community?" Jonas asked. "I just didn't realize there was any 
other way, until I received that memory." 

"It works," The Giver agreed. 

Jonas hesitated. "I certainly liked the memory, though. I can see 
why it's your favorite. I couldn't quite get the word for the whole 
feeling of it, the feeling that was so strong in the room." 

"Love," The Giver told him. 

Jonas repeated it. "Love." It was a word and concept new to him. 

They were both silent for a minute. Then Jonas said, "Giver?"

"Yes?" 

"I feel very foolish saying this. Very, very foolish." 

"No need. Nothing is foolish here. Trust the memories and how they 
make you feel." 

"Well," Jonas said, looking at the floor, "I know you don't have the 
memory anymore, because you gave it to me, so maybe you won't 
understand this--" 

"I will. I am left with a vague wisp of that one; and I have many 
other memories of families, and holidays, and happiness. Of love." 

Jonas blurted out what he was feeling. "I was thinking that ... well, I 
can see that it wasn't a very practical way 



126 



to live, with the Old right there in the same place, where maybe 
they wouldn't be well taken care of, the way they are now, and that 
we have a better-arranged way of doing things. But anyway, I was 
thinking, I mean feeling, actually, that it was kind of nice, then. And 
that I wish we could be that way, and that you could be my 
grandparent. The family in the memory seemed a little more--" He 
faltered, not able to find the word he wanted. 

"A little more complete," The Giver suggested. 

Jonas nodded. "I liked the feeling of love," he confessed. He 
glanced nervously at the speaker on the wall, reassuring himself 
that no one was listening. "I wish we still had that," he whispered. 
"Of course," he added quickly, "I do understand that it wouldn't work 
very well. And that it's much better to be organized the way we are 
now. I can see that it was a dangerous way to live."

"What do you mean?" 

Jonas hesitated. He wasn't certain, really, what he had meant. He 
could feel that there was risk involved, though he wasn't sure how. 
"Well," he said finally, grasping for an explanation, "they had fire 
right there in that room. There was a fire burning in the fireplace. 
And there were candles on a table. I can certainly see why those 
things were outlawed. 

"Still," he said slowly, almost to himself, "I did like the light they 
made. And the warmth." 

"Father? Mother?" Jonas asked tentatively after the evening meal. 
"I have a question I want to ask you." 

"What is it, Jonas?" his father asked. 

He made himself say the words, though he felt flushed 



127 



with embarrassment. He had rehearsed them in his mind all the 
way home from the Annex. 

"Do you love me?" 

There was an awkward silence for a moment. Then Father gave a 
little chuckle. "Jonas. You, of all people. Precision of language, 
please!" 

"What do you mean?" Jonas asked. Amusement was not at all what 
he had anticipated. 

"Your father means that you used a very generalized word, so 
meaningless that it's become almost obsolete," his mother 
explained carefully.

10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 131 of 182 



Jonas stared at them. Meaningless? He had never before felt 
anything as meaningful as the memory. 

"And of course our community can't function smoothly if people 
don't use precise language. You could ask, 'Do you enjoy me?' The 
answer is 'Yes,' " his mother said. 

"Or," his father suggested, " 'Do you take pride in my 
accomplishments?' And the answer is wholeheartedly 'Yes.' " 

"Do you understand why it's inappropriate to use a word like 'love'?" 
Mother asked. 

Jonas nodded. "Yes, thank you, I do," he replied slowly. 

It was his first lie to his parents. 

"Gabriel?" Jonas whispered that night to the newchild. The crib was 
in his room again. After Gabe had slept soundly in Jonas's room for 
four nights, his parents had pronounced the experiment a success 
and Jonas a hero. Gabriel was growing rapidly, now crawling and 
giggling across the room and pulling himself up to stand. He could 



128 



be upgraded in the Nurturing Center, Father said happily, now that 
he slept; he could be officially named and given to his family in 
December, which was only two months away. 

But when he was taken away, he stopped sleeping again, and cried 
in the night. 

So he was back in Jonas's sleepingroom. They would give it a little 
more time, they decided. Since Gabe seemed to like it in Jonas's 
room, he would sleep there at night a little longer, until the habit of 
sound sleep was fully formed. The Nurturers were very optimistic 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 132 of 182 



about Gabriel's future. 

There was no answer to Jonas's whisper. Gabriel was sound 
asleep. 

"Things could change, Gabe," Jonas went on. "Things could be 
different. I don't know how, but there must be some way for things 
to be different. There could be colors. 

"And grandparents," he added, staring through the dimness toward 
the ceiling of his sleepingroom. "And everybody would have the 
memories. 

"You know about memories," he whispered, turning toward the crib. 

Gabriel's breathing was even and deep. Jonas liked having him 
there, though he felt guilty about the secret. Each night he gave 
memories to Gabriel: memories of boat rides and picnics in the sun; 
memories of soft rainfall against windowpanes; memories of 
dancing barefoot on a damp lawn. 

"Gabe?" 

The newchild stirred slightly in his sleep. Jonas looked over at him. 



129 



"There could be love," Jonas whispered. 

The next morning, for the first time, Jonas did not take his pill. 
Something within him, something that had grown there through the 
memories, told him to throw the pill away.

TODAY IS DECLARED AN UNSCHEDULED HOLIDAY. Jonas, his 
parents, and Lily all turned in surprise and looked at the wall 
speaker from which the announcement had come. It happened so 
rarely, and was such a treat for the entire community when it did. 
Adults were exempted from the day's work, children from school 
and training and volunteer hours. The substitute Laborers, who 
would be given a different holiday, took over all the necessary 
tasks: nurturing, food delivery, and care of the Old; and the 
community was free. 

Jonas cheered, and put his homework folder down. He had been 
about to leave for school. School was less important to him now; 
and before much more time passed, his formal schooling would 
end. But still, for Twelves, though they had begun their adult 
training, there were the endless lists of rules to be memorized and 
the newest technology to be mastered. 

He wished his parents, sister, and Gabe a happy day, and rode 
down the bicycle path, looking for Asher. 

He had not taken the pills, now, for four weeks. The Stirrings had 
returned, and he felt a little guilty and embarrassed about the 
pleasurable dreams that came to him 



131 



as he slept. But he knew he couldn't go back to the world of no 
feelings that he had lived in so long. 

And his new, heightened feelings permeated a greater realm than 
simply his sleep. Though he knew that his failure to take the pills 
accounted for some of it, he thought that the feelings came also 
from the memories. Now he could see all of the colors; and he 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 134 of 182 



could /ceepthem, too, so that the trees and grass and bushes 
stayed green in his vision. Gabriel's rosy cheeks stayed pink, even 
when he slept. And apples were always, always red. 

Now, through the memories, he had seen oceans and mountain 
lakes and streams that gurgled through woods; and now he saw the 
familiar wide river beside the path differently. He saw all of the light 
and color and history it contained and carried in its slow-moving 
water; and he knew that there was an Elsewhere from which it 
came, and an Elsewhere to which it was going. 

On this unexpected, casual holiday he felt happy, as he always had 
on holidays; but with a deeper happiness than ever before. 
Thinking, as he always did, about precision of language, Jonas 
realized that it was a new depth of feelings that he was 
experiencing. Somehow they were not at all the same as the 
feelings that every evening, in every dwelling, every citizen 
analyzed with endless talk. 

"I felt angry because someone broke the play area rules," Lily had 
said once, making a fist with her small hand to indicate her fury. 
Her family-Jonas among them--had talked about the possible 
reasons for rule-breaking, and the need for understanding and 
patience, until Lily's fist had relaxed and her anger was gone. 

But Lily had not felt anger, Jonas realized now. Shallow 



132 



impatience and exasperation, that was all Lily had felt. He knew 
that with certainty because now he knew what anger was. Now he 
had, in the memories, experienced injustice and cruelty, and he had 
reacted with rage that welled up so passionately inside him that the 
thought of discussing it calmly at the evening meal was 
unthinkable,

10/19/2010

"I felt sad today," he had heard his mother say, and they had 
comforted her. 

But now Jonas had experienced real sadness. He had felt grief. He 
knew that there was no quick comfort for emotions like those. 

These were deeper and they did not need to be told. They were 
felt. 

Today, he felt happiness. 

"Asher!" He spied his friend's bicycle leaning against a tree at the 
edge of the playing field. Nearby, other bikes were strewn about on 
the ground. On a holiday the usual rules of order could be 
disregarded. 

He skidded to a stop and dropped his own bike beside the others. 
"Hey, Ash!" he shouted, looking around. There seemed to be no 
one in the play area. "Where are you?" 

"Psssheeewwww!" A child's voice, coming from behind a nearby 
bush, made the sound. "Pow! Pow! Pow!" 

A female Eleven named Tanya staggered forward from where she 
had been hiding. Dramatically she clutched her stomach and 
stumbled about in a zig-zag pattern, groaning. "You got me!" she 
called, and fell to the ground, grinning. 

"Blam!" 

Jonas, standing on the side of the playing field, recognized 



133 



Asher's voice. He saw his friend, aiming an imaginary weapon in 
his hand, dart from behind one tree to another. "Blam! You're in my 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml

Page 136 of 182 



line of ambush, Jonas! Watch out!" 

Jonas stepped back. He moved behind Asher's bike and knelt so 
that he was out of sight. It was a game he had often played with the 
other children, a game of good guys and bad guys, a harmless 
pasttime that used up their contained energy and ended only when 
they all lay posed in freakish postures on the ground. 

He had never recognized it before as a game of war. "Attack!" The 
shout came from behind the small storehouse where play 
equipment was kept. Three children dashed forward, their 
imaginary weapons in firing position. 

From the opposite side of the field came an opposing shout: 
"Counter-attack!" From their hiding places a horde of children- 
Jonas recognized Fiona in the group-emerged, running in a 
crouched position, firing across the field. Several of them stopped, 
grabbed their own shoulders and chests with exaggerated 
gestures, and pretended to be hit. They dropped to the ground and 
lay suppressing giggles. 

Feelings surged within Jonas. He found himself walking forward 
into the field. 

"You're hit, Jonas!" Asher yelled from behind the tree. "Pow! You're 
hit again!" 

Jonas stood alone in the center of the field. Several of the children 
raised their heads and looked at him uneasily. The attacking armies 
slowed, emerged from their crouched positions, and watched to see 
what he was doing. 



134 



In his mind, Jonas saw again the face of the boy who had lain dying 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 137 of 182 



on a field and had begged him for water. He had a sudden choking 
feeling, as if it were difficult to breathe. 

One of the children raised an imaginary rifle and made an attempt 
to destroy him with a firing noise. "Pssheeew!" Then they were all 
silent, standing awkwardly, and the only sound was the sound of 
Jonas's shuddering breaths. He was struggling not to cry. 

Gradually, when nothing happened, nothing changed, the children 
looked at each other nervously and went away. He heard the 
sounds as they righted their bicycles and began to ride down the 
path that led from the field. Only Asher and Fiona remained. 

"What's wrong, Jonas? It was only a game," Fiona said. 

"You ruined it," Asher said in an irritated voice. 

"Don't play it anymore," Jonas pleaded. 

"I'm the one who's training for Assistant Recreation Director," Asher 
pointed out angrily. "Games aren't your area of expertness." 

"Expertise," Jonas corrected him automatically. 

"Whatever. You can't say what we play, even if you are going to be 
the new Receiver." Asher looked warily at him. "I apologize for not 
paying you the respect you deserve," he mumbled. 

"Asher," Jonas said. He was trying to speak carefully, and with 
kindness, to say exactly what he wanted to say. "You had no way of 
knowing this. I didn't know it myself until recently. But it's a cruel 
game. In the past, there have--" 



r 



135 



"I said I apologize, Jonas." 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 138 of 182 



Jonas sighed. It was no use. Of course Asher couldn't understand. 

"I accept your apology, Asher," he said wearily. 

"Do you want to go for a ride along the river, Jonas?" Fiona asked, 
biting her lip with nervousness. 

Jonas looked at her. She was so lovely. For a fleeting instant he 
thought he would like nothing better than to ride peacefully along 
the river path, laughing and talking with his gentle female friend. 
But he knew that such times had been taken from him now. He 
shook his head. After a moment his two friends turned and went to 
their bikes. He watched as they rode away. 

Jonas trudged to the bench beside the Storehouse and sat down, 
overwhelmed with feelings of loss. His childhood, his friendships, 
his carefree sense of security-all of these things seemed to be 
slipping away. With his new, heightened feelings, he was 
overwhelmed by sadness at the way the others had laughed and 
shouted, playing at war. But he knew that they could not 
understand why, without the memories. He felt such love for Asher 
and for Fiona. But they could not feel it back, without the memories. 
And he could not give them those. Jonas knew with certainty that 
he could change nothing. 

Back in their dwelling, that evening, Lily chattered merrily about the 
wonderful holiday she had had, playing with her friends, having her 
midday meal out of doors, and (she confessed) sneaking a very 
short try on her father's bicycle. 

"I can't wait till I get my very own bicycle next month. Father's is too 
big for me. I fell," she explained matter-of-factly.

"Good thing Gabe wasn't in the child seat!" 

"A very good thing," Mother agreed, frowning at the idea of it. 
Gabriel waved his arms at the mention of himself. He had begun to 
walk just the week before. The first steps of a newchild were always 
the occasion for celebration at the Nurturing Center, Father said, 
but also for the introduction of a discipline wand. Now Father 
brought the slender instrument home with him each night, in case 
Gabriel misbehaved. 

But he was a happy and easygoing toddler. Now he moved 
unsteadily across the room, laughing. "Gay!" he chirped. "Gay!" It 
was the way he said his own name. 

Jonas brightened. It had been a depressing day for him, after such 
a bright start. But he set his glum thoughts aside. He thought about 
starting to teach Lily to ride so that she could speed off proudly 
after her Ceremony of Nine, which would be coming soon. It was 
hard to believe that it was almost December again, that almost a 
year had passed since he had become a Twelve. 

He smiled as he watched the newchild plant one small foot carefully 
before the other, grinning with glee at his own steps as he tried 
them out. 

"I want to get to sleep early tonight," Father said. "Tomorrow's a 
busy day for me. The twins are being born tomorrow, and the test 
results show that they're identical." 

"One for here, one for Elsewhere," Lily chanted. "One for here, one 
for Else--" 

"Do you actually take it Elsewhere, Father?" Jonas asked. 

"No, I just have to make the selection. I weigh them, hand the larger

over to a Nurturer who's standing by, 



137 



waiting, and then I get the smaller one all cleaned up and comfy. 
Then I perform a small Ceremony of Release and--" He glanced 
down, grinning at Gabriel. "Then I wave bye-bye," he said, in the 
special sweet voice he used when he spoke to the newchild. He 
waved his hand in the familiar gesture. 

Gabriel giggled and waved bye-bye back to him. 

"And somebody else comes to get him? Somebody from 
Elsewhere?" 

"That's right, Jonas-bonus." 

Jonas rolled his eyes in embarrassment that his father had used 
the silly pet name. 

Lily was deep in thought. "What if they give the little twin a name 
Elsewhere, a name like, oh, maybe Jonathan? And here, in our 
community, at his naming, the twin that we kept here is given the 
name Jonathan, and then there would be two children with the 
same name, and they would look exactly the same, and someday, 
maybe when they were a Six, one group of Sixes would go to visit 
another community on a bus, and there in the other community, in 
the other group of Sixes, would be a Jonathan who was exactly the 
same as the other Jonathan, and then maybe they would get mixed 
up and take the wrong Jonathan home, and maybe his parents 
wouldn't notice, and then- 
She paused for breath. 



Lily," Mother said, "I have a wonderful idea. Maybe when you 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 141 of 182 



become a Twelve, they'll give you the Assignment of Storyteller! I 
don't think we've had a Storyteller in the community for a long time. 
But if I were on the Committee, I would definitely choose you for 
that job!" 



138 



Lily grinned. "I have a better idea for one more story," she 
announced. "What if actually we were all twins and didn't know it, 
and so Elsewhere there would be another Lily, and another Jonas, 
and another Father, and another Asher, and another Chief Elder, 
and another--" 



Father groaned. "Lily," he said. "It's bedtime." 



139

"Giver," Jonas asked the next afternoon, "Do you ever think about 
release?" 

"Do you mean my own release, or just the general topic of 
release?" 

"Both, I guess. I apologi— I mean I should have been more precise. 
But I don't know exactly what I meant." 

"Sit back up. No need to lie down while we're talking." Jonas, who 
had already been stretched out on the bed when the question came 
to his mind, sat back up. 

"I guess I do think about it occasionally," The Giver said. "I think 
about my own release when I'm in an awful lot of pain. I wish I 
could put in a request for it, sometimes. But I'm not permitted to do 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 142 of 182 



that until the new Receiver is trained." 



"Me," Jonas said in a dejected voice. He was not looking forward to 
the end of the training, when he would become the new Receiver. It 
was clear to him what a terribly difficult and lonely life it was, 
despite the honor. 

"I can't request release either," Jonas pointed out. "It was in my 
rules." 

The Giver laughed harshly. "I know that. They hammered out those 
rules after the failure ten years ago." 



140 



Jonas had heard again and again now, reference to the previous 
failure. But he still did not know what had happened ten years 
before. "Giver," he said, "tell me what happened. Please." 

The Giver shrugged. "On the surface, it was quite simple. A 
Receiver-to-be was selected, the way you were. The selection went 
smoothly enough. The Ceremony was held, and the selection was 
made. The crowd cheered, as they did for you. The new Receiver 
was puzzled and a little frightened, as you were." 

"My parents told me it was a female." 

The Giver nodded. 

Jonas thought of his favorite female, Fiona, and shivered. He 
wouldn't want his gentle friend to suffer the way he had, taking on 
the memories. "What was she like?" he asked The Giver. 

The Giver looked sad, thinking about it. "She was a remarkable 
young woman. Very self-possessed and serene. Intelligent, eager 
to learn." He shook his head and drew a deep breath. "You know, 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 143 of 182 



Jonas, when she came to me in this room, when she presented 
herself to begin her training-- " 

Jonas interrupted him with a question. "Can you tell me her name? 
My parents said that it wasn't to be spoken again in the community. 
But couldn't you say it just to me?" 

The Giver hesitated painfully, as if saying the name aloud might be 
excruciating. "Her name was Rosemary," he told Jonas, finally. 

"Rosemary. I like that name." 

The Giver went on. "When she came to me for the first 



141 



time, she sat there in the chair where you sat on your first day. She 
was eager and excited and a little scared. We talked. I tried to 
explain things as well as I could." 

"The way you did to me." 

The Giver chuckled ruefully. "The explanations are difficult. The 
whole thing is so beyond one's experience. But I tried. And she 
listened carefully. Her eyes were very luminous, I remember." 

He looked up suddenly. "Jonas, I gave you a memory that I told you 
was my favorite. I still have a shred of it left. The room, with the 
family, and grandparents?" 

Jonas nodded. Of course he remembered. "Yes," he said. "It had 
that wonderful feeling with it. You told me it was love." 

"You can understand, then, that that's what I felt for Rosemary," 
The Giver explained. "I loved her. "I feel it for you, too," he added. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 144 of 182 



"What happened to her?" Jonas asked. 

"Her training began. She received well, as you do. She was so 
enthusiastic. So delighted to experience new things. I remember 
her laughter ... " 

His voice faltered and trailed off. 

"What happened?" Jonas asked again, after a moment. "Please tell 
me." 

The Giver closed his eyes. "It broke my heart, Jonas, to transfer 
pain to her. But it was my job. It was what I had to do, the way I've 
had to do it to you." 

The room was silent. Jonas waited. Finally The Giver continued. 

"Five weeks. That was all. I gave her happy memories: a ride on a 
merry-go-round; a kitten to play with; a picnic. 



142 



Sometimes I chose one just because I knew it would make her 
laugh, and I so treasured the sound of that laughter in this room 
that had always been so silent. 

"But she was like you, Jonas. She wanted to experience everything. 
She knew that it was her responsibility. And so she asked me for 
more difficult memories." 

Jonas held his breath for a moment. "You didn't give her war, did 
you? Not after just five weeks?" 

The Giver shook his head and sighed. "No. And I didn't give her 
physical pain. But I gave her loneliness. And I gave her loss. I 
transferred a memory of a child taken from its parents. That was the 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 145 of 182 



first one. She appeared stunned at its end." 

Jonas swallowed. Rosemary, and her laughter, had begun to seem 
real to him, and he pictured her looking up from the bed of 
memories, shocked. 

The Giver continued. "I backed off, gave her more little delights. But 
everything changed, once she knew about pain. I could see it in her 
eyes." 

"She wasn't brave enough?" Jonas suggested. 

The Giver didn't respond to the question. "She insisted that I 
continue, that I not spare her. She said it was her duty. And I knew, 
of course, that she was correct. 

"I couldn't bring myself to inflict physical pain on her. But I gave her 
anguish of many kinds. Poverty, and hunger, and terror. 

"I had\o, Jonas. It was my job. And she had been chosen." The 
Giver looked at him imploringly. Jonas stroked his hand. 

"Finally one afternoon, we finished for the day. It had been a hard 
session. I tried to finish-as I do with 



143 



you-by transferring something happy and cheerful. But the times of 
laughter were gone by then. She stood up very silently, frowning, 
as if she were making a decision. Then she came over to me and 
put her arms around me. She kissed my cheek." As Jonas watched, 
The Giver stroked his own cheek, recalling the touch of Rosemary's 
lips ten years before. 

"She left here that day, left this room, and did not go back to her 
dwelling. I was notified by the Speaker that she had gone directly to 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010

Page 146 of 182 



the Chief Elder and asked to be released." 

"But it's against the rules! The Receiver-in-training can't apply for 
rel-" 

"It's in your rules, Jonas. But it wasn't in hers. She asked for 
release, and they had to give it to her. I never saw her again." 

So that was the failure, Jonas thought. It was obvious that it 
saddened The Giver very deeply. But it didn't seem such a terrible 
thing, after all. And he, Jonas, would never have done it~never 
have requested release, no matter now difficult his training became. 
The Giver needed a successor, and he had been chosen. 

A thought occurred to Jonas. Rosemary had been released very 
early in her training. What if something happened to him, Jonas? 
He had a whole year's worth of memories now. 

"Giver," he asked, "I can't request release, I know that. But what if 
something happened: an accident? What if I fell into the river like 
the little Four, Caleb, did? Well, that doesn't make sense because 
I'm a good swimmer. But what if I couldn't swim, and fell into the 
river and was 



144 



lost? Then there wouldn't be a new Receiver, but you would already 
have given away an awful lot of important memories, so even 
though they would select a new Receiver, the memories would be 
gone except for the shreds that you have left of them? And then 
what if- " 

He started to laugh, suddenly. "I sound like my sister, Lily," he said, 
amused at himself.

The Giver looked at him gravely. "You just stay away from the river, 
my friend," he said. "The community lost Rosemary after five weeks 
and it was a disaster for them. I don't know whatXhe community 
would do if they lost you." 

"Why was it a disaster?" 

"I think I mentioned to you once," The Giver reminded him, "that 
when she was gone, the memories came back to the people. If you 
were to be lost in the river, Jonas, your memories would not be lost 
with you. Memories are forever. 

"Rosemary had only those five weeks worth, and most of them 
were good ones. But there were those few terrible memories, the 
ones that had overwhelmed her. For a while they overwhelmed the 
community. All those feelings! They'd never experienced that 
before. 

"I was so devastated by my own grief at her loss, and my own 
feeling of failure, that I didn't even try to help them through it. I was 
angry, too." 

The Giver was quiet for a moment, obviously thinking. "You know," 
he said, finally, "if they lost you, with all the training you've had now, 
they'd have all those memories again themselves." 

Jonas made a face. "They'd hate that." 



145 



"They certainly would. They wouldn't know how to deal with it at 
all." 

"The only way I deal with it is by having you there to help me," 
Jonas pointed out with a sigh.

The Giver 



Page 148 of 182 



The Giver nodded. "I suppose," he said slowly, "that I could--" 

"You could what?" 

The Giver was still deep in thought. After a moment, he said, "If you 
floated off in the river, I suppose I could help the whole community 
the way I've helped you. It's an interesting concept. I need to think 
about it some more. Maybe we'll talk about it again sometime. But 
not now. 



"I'm glad you're a good swimmer, Jonas. But stay away from the 
river." He laughed a little, but the laughter was not lighthearted. His 
thoughts seemed to be elsewhere, and his eyes were very troubled. 



146

Jonas glanced at the clock. There was so much work to be done, 
always, that he and The Giver seldom simply sat and talked, the 
way they just had. 

"I'm sorry that I wasted so much time with my questions," Jonas 
said. "I was only asking about release because my father is 
releasing a newchild today. A twin. He has to select one and 
release the other one. They do it by weight." Jonas glanced at the 
clock. "Actually, I suppose he's already finished. I think it was this 
morning." 

The Giver's face took on a solemn look. "I wish they wouldn't do 
that," he said quietly, almost to himself. 

"Well, they can't have two identical people around! Think how 
confusing it would be!" Jonas chuckled.

The Giver 



Page 149 of 182 



"I wish I could watch," he added, as an afterthought. He liked the 
thought of seeing his father perform the ceremony, and making the 
little twin clean and comfy. His father was such a gentle man. 

"You can watch," The Giver said. 

"No," Jonas told him. "They never let children watch. It's very 
private." 

"Jonas," The Giver told him, "I know that you read your training 
instructions very carefully. Don't you remember that you are 
allowed to ask anyone anything?" 



147 



Jonas nodded. "Yes, but-- " 

"Jonas, when you and I have finished our time together, you will be 
the new Receiver. You can read the books; you'll have the 
memories. You have access to everything. It's part of your training. 
If you want to watch a release, you have simply to ask." 

Jonas shrugged. "Well, maybe I will, then. But it's too late for this 
one. I'm sure it was this morning." 

The Giver told him, then, something he had not known. "All private 
ceremonies are recorded. They're in the Hall of Closed Records. 
Do you want to see this morning's release?" 

Jonas hesitated. He was afraid that his father wouldn't like it, if he 
watched something so private. 

"I think you should," The Giver told him firmly. 

"All right, then," Jonas said. "Tell me how."

10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 150 of 182 



The Giver rose from his chair, went to the speaker on the wall, and 
clicked the switch from OFF to ON. 

The voice spoke immediately. "Yes, Receiver. How may I help 
you?" 

"I would like to see this morning's release of the twin." 

"One moment, Receiver. Thank you for your instructions." 

Jonas watched the video screen above the row of switches. Its 
blank face began to flicker with zig-zag lines; then some numbers 
appeared, followed by the date and time. He was astonished and 
delighted that this was available to him, and surprised that he had 
not known. 

Suddenly he could see a small windowless room, empty except for 
a bed, a table with some equipment on it-Jonas recognized a 
scale; he had seen them before, when he'd been doing volunteer 
hours at the Nurturing Center- 



US 



and a cupboard. He could see pale carpeting on the floor. 

"It's just an ordinary room," he commented. "I thought maybe they'd 
have it in the Auditorium, so that everybody could come. All the Old 
go to Ceremonies of Release. But I suppose that when it's just a 
newborn, they don't-" 

"Shhh," The Giver said, his eyes on the screen. Jonas's father, 
wearing his nurturing uniform, entered the room, cradling a tiny 
newchild wrapped in a soft blanket in his arms. A uniformed woman 
followed through the door, carrying a second newchild wrapped in a 
similar blanket. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 151 of 182 



"That's my father." Jonas found himself whispering, as if he might 
wake the little ones if he spoke aloud. "And the other Nurturer is his 
assistant. She's still in training, but she'll be finished soon." 

The two Nurturers unwrapped the blankets and laid the identical 
newborns on the bed. They were naked. Jonas could see that they 
were males. 

He watched, fascinated, as his father gently lifted one and then the 
other to the scale and weighed them. 

He heard his father laugh. "Good," his father said to the woman. "I 
thought for a moment that they might both be exactly the same. 
Then we'd have a problem. But this one," he handed one, after 
rewrapping it, to his assistant, "is six pounds even. So you can 
clean him up and dress him and take him over to the Center." 

The woman took the newchild and left through the door she had 
entered. 

Jonas watched as his father bent over the squirming newchild on 
the bed. "And you, little guy, you're only five 






149 



pounds ten ounces. A s hrimp!" 

"That's the special voice he uses with Gabriel," Jonas remarked, 
smiling. 

"Watch," The Giver said. 

"Now he cleans him up and makes him comfy," Jonas told him. "He 
told me." 

"Be quiet, Jonas," The Giver commanded in a strange voice. " 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 152 of 182 



Watch ." 

Obediently Jonas concentrated on the screen, waiting for what 
would happen next. He was especially curious about the ceremony 
part. 

His father turned and opened the cupboard. He took out a syringe 
and a small bottle. Very carefully he inserted the needle into the 
bottle and began to fill the syringe with a clear liquid. 

Jonas winced sympathetically. He had forgotten that newchildren 
had to get shots. He hated shots himself, though he knew that they 
were necessary. 

To his surprise, his father began very carefully to direct the needle 
into the top of newchild's forehead, puncturing the place where the 
fragile skin pulsed. The newborn squirmed, and wailed faintly. 

"Why's he--" 

"Shhh," The Giver said sharply. 

His father was talking, and Jonas realized that he was hearing the 
answer to the question he had started to ask. Still in the special 
voice, his father was saying, "I know, I know. It hurts, little guy. But I 
have to use a vein, and the veins in your arms are still too teeny- 
weeny." 

He pushed the plunger very slowly, injecting the liquid into the scalp 
vein until the syringe was empty. 



150 



"All done. That wasn't so bad, was it?" Jonas heard his father say 
cheerfully. He turned aside and dropped the syringe into a waste 
receptacle. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 153 of 182 



Now he cleans him up and makes him comfy, Jonas said to 
himself, aware that The Giver didn't want to talk during the little 
ceremony. 

As he continued to watch, the newchild, no longer crying, moved 
his arms and legs in a jerking motion. Then he went limp. He head 
fell to the side, his eyes half open. Then he was still. 

With an odd, shocked feeling, Jonas recognized the gestures and 
posture and expression. They were familiar. He had seen them 
before. But he couldn't remember where. 

Jonas stared at the screen, waiting for something to happen. But 
nothing did. The little twin lay motionless. His father was putting 
things away. Folding the blanket. Closing the cupboard. 

Once again, as he had on the playing field, he felt the choking 
sensation. Once again he saw the face of the light-haired, bloodied 
soldier as life left his eyes. The memory came back. 

He killed it! My father killed it! Jona s said to himself, stunned at 
what he was realizing. He continued to stare at the screen numbly. 

His father tidied the room. Then he picked up a small carton that lay 
waiting on the floor, set it on the bed, and lifted the limp body into it. 
He placed the lid on tightly. 

He picked up the carton and carried it to the other side of the room. 
He opened a small door in the wall; Jonas could see darkness 
behind the door. It seemed to be the 



151 



same sort of chute into which trash was deposited at school. 

His father loaded the carton containing the body into the chute and 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 154 of 182 



gave it a shove. 

"Bye-bye, little guy," Jonas heard his father say before he left the 
room. Then the screen went blank. 

The Giver turned to him. Quite calmly, he related, "When the 
Speaker notified me that Rosemary had applied for release, they 
turned on the tape to show me the process. There she was~my last 
glimpse of that beautiful child-waiting. They brought in the syringe 
and asked her to roll up her sleeve. 

"You suggested, Jonas, that perhaps she wasn't brave enough? I 
don't know about bravery: what it is, what it means. I do know that I 
sat here numb with horror. Wretched with helplessness. And I 
listened as Rosemary told them that she would prefer to inject 
herself. 

"Then she did so. I didn't watch. I looked away." The Giver turned 
to him. "Well, there you are, Jonas. You were wondering about 
release," he said in a bitter voice. 

Jonas felt a ripping sensation inside himself, the feeling of terrible 
pain clawing its way forward to emerge in a cry. 



152 



20 

"I won't! I won't go home! You can't make me!" Jonas sobbed and 
shouted and pounded the bed with his fists. 

"Sit up, Jonas," The Giver told him firmly. 

Jonas obeyed him. Weeping, shuddering, he sat on the edge of the 
bed. He would not look at The Giver. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 155 of 182 



"You may stay here tonight. I want to talk to you. But you must be 
quiet now, while I notify your family unit. No one must hear you cry." 

Jonas looked up wildly. "No one heard that little twin cry, either! No 
one but my father!" He collapsed in sobs again. 

The Giver waited silently. Finally Jonas was able to quiet himself 
and he sat huddled, his shoulders shaking. 

The Giver went to the wall speaker and clicked the switch to ON. 

"Yes, Receiver. How may I help you?" 

"Notify the new Receiver's family unit that he will be staying with me 
tonight, for additional training." 

"I will take care of that, sir. Thank you for your instructions," the 
voice said. 

"I will take care of that, sir. I will take care of that, sir," Jonas 
mimicked in a cruel, sarcastic voice. "I will do whatever 



153 



you like, sir. I will kill people, sir. Old people? Small newborn 
people? I'd be happy to kill them, sir. Thank you for your 
instructions, sir. How may I help y--', He couldn't seem to stop. 

The Giver grasped his shoulders firmly. Jonas fell silent and stared 
at him. 

"Listen to me, Jonas. They can't help it. They know nothing." 

"You said that to me once before." 

"I said it because it's true. It's the way they live. It's the life that was 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 156 of 182 



created for them. It's the same life that you would have, if you had 
not been chosen as my successor." "But he HedXo me!" Jonas 
wept. 

"It's what he was told to do, and he knows nothing else." 

"What about you? Do you lie to me, too?" Jonas almost spat the 
question at The Giver. 

"I am empowered to lie. But I have never lied to you." 

Jonas stared at him. "Release is always like that? For people who 
break the rules three times? For the Old? Do they kill the Old, too?" 

"Yes, it's true." 

"And what about Fiona? She loves the Old! She's in training to care 
for them. Does she know yet? What will she do when she finds out? 
How will she feel?" Jonas brushed wetness from his face with the 
back of one hand. 

"Fiona is already being trained in the fine art of release," The Giver 
told him. "She's very efficient at her work, your red-haired friend. 
Feelings are not part of the life she's learned." 

Jonas wrapped his arms around himself and rocked his 



154 



own body back and forth. "What should I do? I can't go back! I 
can't!" 

The Giver stood up. "First, I will order our evening meal. Then we 
will eat." 

Jonas found himself using the nasty, sarcastic voice again. "Then 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 157 of 182 



we'll have a sharing of feelings?" 

The Giver gave a rueful, anguished, empty laugh. "Jonas, you and I 
are the only ones who have feelings. We've been sharing them now 
for almost a year." 

"I'm sorry, Giver," Jonas said miserably. "I don't mean to be so 
hateful. Not to you." 

The Giver rubbed Jonas's hunched shoulders. "And after we eat," 
he went on, "we'll make a plan." 

Jonas looked up, puzzled. "A plan for what? There's nothing. 
There's nothing we can do. It's always been this way. Before me, 
before you, before the ones who came before you. Back and back 
and back." His voice trailed the familiar phrase. 

"Jonas," The Giver said, after a moment, "it's true that it has been 
this way for what seems forever. But the memories tell us that it has 
not always been. People felt things once. You and I have been part 
of that, so we know. We know that they once felt things like pride, 
and sorrow, and--" 

"And love," Jonas added, remembering the family scene that had 
so affected him. "And pain." He thought again of the soldier. 

"The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the 
loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared." 

"I've started to share them with you," Jonas said, trying to cheer 
him. 



155 



"That's true. And having you here with me over the past year has 
made me realize that things must change. For years I've felt that 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 158 of 182 



they should, but it seemed so hopeless. 

"Now for the first time I think there might be a way," The Giver said 
slowly. "And you brought it to my attention, barely-- " He glanced at 
the dock, "two hours ago." 

Jonas watched him, and listened. 

It was late at night, now. They had talked and talked. Jonas sat 
wrapped in a robe belonging to The Giver, the long robe that only 
Elders wore. 

It was possible, what they had planned. Barely possible. If it failed, 
he would very likely be killed. 

But what did that matter? If he stayed, his life was no longer worth 
living. 

"Yes," he told The Giver. "I'll do it. I think I can do it. I'll try, anyway. 
But I want you to come with me." 

The Giver shook his head. "Jonas," he said, "the community has 
depended, all these generations, back and back and back, on a 
resident Receiver to hold their memories for them. I've turned over 
many of them to you in the past year. And I can't take them back. 
There's no way for me to get them back if I have given them. 

"So if you escape, once you are gone--and, Jonas, you know that 
you can never return--" 

Jonas nodded solemnly. It was the terrifying part. "Yes," he said, "I 
know. But if you come with me--" 

The Giver shook his head and made a gesture to silence him. He 
continued. "If you get away, if you get beyond, if you get to 
Elsewhere, it will mean that the community

The Giver

156 



has to bear the burden themselves, of the memories you had been 
holding for them. 

"I think that they can, and that they will acquire some wisdom. But it 
will be desperately hard for them. When we lost Rosemary ten 
years ago, and her memories returned to the people, they 
panicked. And those were such few memories, compared to yours. 
When your memories return, they'll need help. Remember how I 
helped you in the beginning, when the receiving of memories was 
new to you?" 

Jonas nodded. "It was scary at first. And it hurt a lot." 

"You needed me then. And now they will." 

"It's no use. They'll find someone to take my place. They'll choose a 
new Receiver." 

"There's no one ready for training, not right away. Oh, they'll speed 
up the selection, of course. But I can't think of another child who 
has the right qualities--" 

"There's a little female with pale eyes. But she's only a Six." 

"That's correct. I know the one you mean. Her name is Katharine. 
But she's too young. So they will be forcedXo bear those 
memories." 

"I want you to come, Giver," Jonas pleaded. 

"No. I have to stay here," The Giver said firmly. "I want to, Jonas. If 
I go with you, and together we take away all their protection from 
the memories, Jonas, the community will be left with no one to help 
them. They'll be thrown into chaos. They'll destroy themselves. I 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 160 of 182 



can't go." 

"Giver," Jonas suggested, "you and I don't need to care about the 
rest of them." 



157 



The Giver looked at him with a questioning smile. Jonas hung his 
head. Of course they needed to care. It was the meaning of 
everything. 

"And in any case, Jonas," The Giver sighed, "I wouldn't make it. I'm 
very weakened now. Do you know that I no longer see colors?" 

Jonas's heart broke. He reached for The Giver's hand. 

"You have the colors," The Giver told him. "And you have the 
courage. I will help you to have the strength." 

"A year ago," Jonas reminded him, "when I had just become a 
Twelve, when I began to see the first color, you told me that the 
beginning had been different for you. But that I wouldn't 
understand." 

The Giver brightened. "That's true. And do you know, Jonas, that 
with all your knowledge now, with all your memories, with all you've 
learned-- still you won't understand? Because I've been a little 
selfish. I haven't given any of it to you. I wanted to keep it for myself 
to the last." 

"Keep what?" 

"When I was just a boy, younger than you, it began to come to me. 
But it wasn't the seeing-beyond for me. It was different. For me, it 
was hearing-bey ond. " 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 161 of 182 



Jonas frowned, trying to figure that out. "What did you hear?" he 
asked. 

"Music," The Giver said, smiling. "I began to hear something truly 
remarkable, and it is called music. I'll give you some before I go." 

Jonas shook his head emphatically. "No, Giver," he said. "I want 
you to keep that, to have with you, when I'm gone." 



158 



Jonas went home the next morning, cheerfully greeted his parents, 
and lied easily about what a busy, pleasant night he had had. 

His father smiled and lied easily, too, about his busy and pleasant 
day the day before. 

Throughout the school day, as he did his lessons, Jonas went over 
the plan in his head. It seemed startlingly simple. Jonas and The 
Giver had gone over it and over it, late into the night hours. 

For the next two weeks, as the time for the December Ceremony 
approached, The Giver would transfer every memory of courage 
and strength that he could to Jonas. He would need those to help 
him find the Elsewhere that they were both sure existed. They knew 
it would be a very difficult journey. 

Then, in the middle of the night before the Ceremony, Jonas would 
secretly leave his dwelling. This was probably the most dangerous 
part, because it was a violation of a major rule for any citizen not on 
official business to leave a dwelling at night. 

"I'll leave at midnight," Jonas said. "The Food Collectors will be 
finished picking up the evening-meal remains by then, and the 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 162 of 182 



Path-Maintenance Crews don't start their work that early. So there 
won't be anyone to see me, unless of course someone is out on 
emergency business." 

"I don't know what you should do if you are seen, Jonas," The Giver 
had said. "I have memories, of course, of all kinds of escapes. 
People fleeing from terrible things throughout history. But every 
situation is individual. There is no memory of one like this." 

"I'll be careful," Jonas said. "No one will see me." 



159 



"As Receiver-in-training, you're held in very high respect already. 
So I think you wouldn't be questioned very forcefully." 

"I'd just say I was on some important errand for the Receiver. I'd 
say it was all your fault that I was out after hours," Jonas teased. 

They both laughed a little nervously. But Jonas was certain that he 
could slip away, unseen, from his house, carrying an extra set of 
clothing. Silently he would take his bicycle to the riverbank and 
leave it there hidden in bushes with the clothing folded beside it. 

Then he would make his way through the darkness, on foot, 
silently, to the Annex. 

"There's no nighttime attendant," The Giver explained. "I'll leave the 
door unlocked. You simply slip into the room. I'll be waiting for you." 

His parents would discover, when they woke, that he was gone. 
They would also find a cheerful note from Jonas on his bed, telling 
them that he was going for an early morning ride along the river; 
that he would be back for the Ceremony. 

His parents would be irritated but not alarmed. They would think 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 163 of 182 



him inconsiderate and they would plan to chastise him, later. 

They would wait, with mounting anger, for him; finally they would be 
forced to go, taking Lily to the Ceremony without him. 

"They won't say anything to anyone, though," Jonas said, quite 
certain. "They won't call attention to my rudeness because it would 
reflect on their parenting. And anyway, everyone is so involved in 
the Ceremony that they 



160 



probably won't notice that I'm not there. Now that I'm a Twelve and 
in training, I don't have to sit with my age group any more. So Asher 
will think I'm with my parents, or with you--" 

"And your parents will assume you're with Asher, or with me--" 

Jonas shrugged. "It will take everyone a while to realize that I'm not 
there at all." 

"And you and I will be long on our way by then." 

In the early morning, The Giver would order a vehicle and driver 
from the Speaker. He visited the other communities frequently, 
meeting with their Elders; his responsibilities extended over all the 
surrounding areas. So this would not be an unusual undertaking. 

Ordinarily The Giver did not attend the December Ceremony. Last 
year he had been present because of the occasion of Jonas's 
selection, in which he was so involved. But his life was usually quite 
separate from that of the community. No one would comment on 
his absence, or on the fact that he had chosen this day to be away. 

When the driver and vehicle arrived, The Giver would send the 
driver on some brief errand. During his absence, The Giver would 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 164 of 182 



help Jonas hide in the storage area of the vehicle. He would have 
with him a bundle of food which The Giver would save from his own 
meals during the next two weeks. 

The Ceremony would begin, with all the community there, and by 
then Jonas and The Giver would be on their way. 

By midday Jonas's absence would become apparent, and would be 
a cause for serious concern. The Ceremony

would not be disrupted-such a disruption would be unthinkable. 
But searchers would be sent out into the community. 

By the time his bicycle and clothing were found, The Giver would 
be returning. Jonas, by then, would be on his own, making his 
journey Elsewhere. 

The Giver, on his return, would find the community in a state of 
confusion and panic. Confronted by a situation which they had 
never faced before, and having no memories from which to find 
either solace or wisdom, they would not know what to do and would 
seek his advice. 

He would go to the Auditorium where the people would be 
gathered, still. He would stride to the stage and command their 
attention. 

He would make the solemn announcement that Jonas had been 
lost in the river. He would immediately begin the Ceremony of Loss. 

"Jonas, Jonas," they would say loudly, as they had once said the 
name of Caleb. The Giver would lead the chant. Together they 
would let Jonas's presence in their lives fade away as they said his

name in unison more slowly, softer and softer, until he was 
disappearing from them, until he was no more than an occasional 
murmur and then, by the end of the long day, gone forever, not to 
be mentioned again. 

Their attention would turn to the overwhelming task of bearing the 
memories themselves. The Giver would help them. 

"Yes, I understand that they'll need you," Jonas had said at the end 
of the lengthy discussion and planning. "But 



162 



I'll need you, too. Please come with me." He knew the answer even 
as he made the final plea. 

"My work will be finished," The Giver had replied gently, "when I 
have helped the community to change and become whole. 

"I'm grateful to you, Jonas, because without you I would never have 
figured out a way to bring about the change. But your role now is to 
escape. And my role is to stay." 

"But don't you wantXo be with me, Giver?" Jonas asked sadly. 

The Giver hugged him. "I love you, Jonas," he said. "But I have 
another place to go. When my work here is finished, I want to be 
with my daughter." 

Jonas had been staring glumly at the floor. Now he looked up, 
startled. "I didn't know you had a daughter, Giver! You told me that 
you'd had a spouse. But I never knew about your daughter." 

The Giver smiled, and nodded. For the first time in their long 
months together, Jonas saw him look truly happy.

"Her name was Rosemary," The Giver said.

It would work. They could make it work, Jonas told himself again 
and again throughout the day. 

But that evening everything changed. All of it--a.ll the things they 
had thought through so meticulously-fell apart. 

That night, Jonas was forced to flee. He left the dwelling shortly 
after the sky became dark and the community still. It was terribly 
dangerous because some of the work crews were still about, but he 
moved stealthily and silently, staying in the shadows, making his 
way past the darkened dwellings and the empty Central Plaza, 
toward the river. Beyond the Plaza he could see the House of the 
Old, with the Annex behind it, outlined against the night sky. But he 
could not stop there. There was no time. Every minute counted 
now, and every minute must take him farther from the community. 

Now he was on the bridge, hunched over on the bicycle, pedaling 
steadily. He could see the dark, churning water far below. 

He felt, surprisingly, no fear, nor any regret at leaving 






164 



the community behind. But he felt a very deep sadness that he had 
left his closest friend behind. He knew that in the danger of his 
escape he must be absolutely silent; but with his heart and mind, 
he called back and hoped that with his capacity for hearing-beyond, 
The Giver would know that Jonas had said goodbye.

It had happened at the evening meal. The family unit was eating 
together as always: Lily chattering away, Mother and Father making 
their customary comments (and lies, Jonas knew) about the day. 
Nearby, Gabriel played happily on the floor, babbling his baby talk, 
looking with glee now and then toward Jonas, obviously delighted 
to have him back after the unexpected night away from the 
dwelling. 

Father glanced down toward the toddler. "Enjoy it, little guy," he 
said. "This is your last night as visitor." 

"What do you mean?" Jonas asked him. 

Father sighed with disappointment. "Well, you know he wasn't here 
when you got home this morning because we had him stay 
overnight at the Nurturing Center. It seemed like a good 
opportunity, with you gone, to give it a try. He'd been sleeping so 
soundly." 

"Didn't it go well?" Mother asked sympathetically. 

Father gave a rueful laugh. "That's an understatement. It was a 
disaster. He cried all night, apparently. The night crew couldn't 
handle it. They were really frazzled by the time I got to work." 

"Gabe, you naughty thing," Lily said, with a scolding little cluck 
toward the grinning toddler on the floor. 

"So," Father went on, "we obviously had to make the 



165 



decision. Even I voted for Gabriel's release when we had the 
meeting this afternoon." 

Jonas put down his fork and stared at his father. "Release?" he 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 168 of 182 



asked. 

Father nodded. "We certainly gave it our best try, didn't we?" 

"Yes, we did," Mother agreed emphatically. 

Lily nodded in agreement, too. 

Jonas worked at keeping his voice absolutely calm. "When?" he 
asked. "When will he be released?" 

"First thing tomorrow morning. We have to start our preparations for 
the Naming Ceremony, so we thought we'd get this taken care of 
right away. 

"It's bye-bye to you, Gabe, in the morning," Father had said, in his 
sweet, sing-song voice. 

Jonas reached the opposite side of the river, stopped briefly, and 
looked back. The community where his entire life had been lived lay 
behind him now, sleeping. At dawn, the orderly, disciplined life he 
had always known would continue again, without him. The life 
where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. 
The life without color, pain, or past. 

He pushed firmly again at the pedal with his foot and continued 
riding along the road. It was not safe to spend time looking back. 
He thought of the rules he had broken so far: enough that if he 
were caught, now, he would be condemned. 

First, he had left the dwelling at night. A major transgression. 
Second, he had robbed the community of food: a very 

166 
serious crime, even though what he had taken was leftovers, set 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 169 of 182 



out on the dwelling doorsteps for collection. 

Third, he had stolen his father's bicycle. He had hesitated for a 
moment, standing beside the bikeport in the darkness, not wanting 
anything of his father's and uncertain, as well, whether he could 
comfortably ride the larger bike when he was so accustomed to his 
own. 

But it was necessary because it had the child seat attached to the 
back. 

And he had taken Gabriel, too. 

He could feel the little head nudge his back, bouncing gently 
against him as he rode. Gabriel was sleeping soundly, strapped 
into the seat. Before he had left the dwelling, he had laid his hands 
firmly on Gabe's back and transmitted to him the most soothing 
memory he could: a slow-swinging hammock under palm trees on 
an island someplace, at evening, with a rhythmic sound of languid 
water lapping hypnotically against a beach nearby. As the memory 
seeped from him into the newchild, he could feel Gabe's sleep ease 
and deepen. There had been no stir at all when Jonas lifted him 
from the crib and placed him gently into the molded seat. 

He knew that he had the remaining hours of night before they 
would be aware of his escape. So he rode hard, steadily, willing 
himself not to tire as the minutes and miles passed. There had 
been no time to receive the memories he and The Giver had 
counted on, of strength and courage. So he relied on what he had, 
and hoped it would be enough. 

He circled the outlying communities, their dwellings 



167 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver Page 170 of 182 



dark. Gradually the distances between communities widened, with 
longer stretches of empty road. His legs ached at first; then, as time 
passed, they became numb. 

At dawn Gabriel began to stir. They were in an isolated place; fields 
on either side of the road were dotted with thickets of trees here 
and there. He saw a stream, and made his way to it across a rutted, 
bumpy meadow; Gabriel, wide awake now, giggled as the bicycle 
jolted him up and down. 

Jonas unstrapped Gabe, lifted him from the bike, and watched him 
investigate the grass and twigs with delight. Carefully he hid the 
bicycle in thick bushes. 

"Morning meal, Gabe!" He unwrapped some of the food and fed 
them both. Then he filled the cup he had brought with water from 
the stream and held it for Gabriel to drink. He drank thirstily himself, 
and sat by the stream, watching the newchild play. 

He was exhausted. He knew he must sleep, resting his own 
muscles and preparing himself for more hours on the bicycle. It 
would not be safe to travel in daylight. 

They would be looking for him soon. 

He found a place deeply hidden in the trees, took the newchild 
there, and lay down, holding Gabriel in his arms. Gabe struggled 
cheerfully as if it were a wrestling game, the kind they had played 
back in the dwelling, with tickles and laughter. 

"Sorry, Gabe," Jonas told him. "I know it's morning, and I know you 
just woke up. But we have to sleep now. 

He cuddled the small body close to him, and rubbed the little back. 
He murmured to Gabriel soothingly. Then 



file://C :\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea_Poplow\The_Giver.xml 1 0/1 9/20 10 



The Giver 



Page 171 of 182 



168 



he pressed his hands firmly and transmitted a memory of deep, 
contented exhaustion. Gabriel's head nodded, after a moment and 
fell against Jonas's chest. 

Together the fugitives slept through the first dangerous day. 

The most terrifying thing was the planes. By now, days had passed; 
Jonas no longer knew how many. The journey had become 
automatic: the sleep by days, hidden in underbrush and trees; the 
finding of water; the careful division of scraps of food, augmented 
by what he could find in the fields. And the endless, endless miles 
on the bicycle by night. 

His leg muscles were taut now. They ached when he settled 
himself to sleep. But they were stronger, and he stopped now less 
often to rest. Sometimes he paused and lifted Gabriel down for a 
brief bit of exercise, running down the road or through a field 
together in the dark. But always, when he returned, strapped the 
uncomplaining toddler into the seat again, and remounted, his legs 
were ready. 

So he had enough strength of his own, and had not needed what 
The Giver might have provided, had there been time. 

But when the planes came, he wished that he could have received 
the courage. 

He knew they were search planes. They flew so low that they woke 
him with the noise of their engines, and sometimes, looking out and 
up fearfully from the hiding places, he could almost see the faces of 
the searchers. 

He knew that they could not see color, and that their 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 172 of 182 



169 



flesh, as well as Gabriel's light golden curls, would be no more than 
smears of gray against the colorless foliage. But he remembered 
from his science and technology studies at school that the search 
planes used heat-seeking devices which could identify body 
warmth and would hone in on two humans huddled in shrubbery. 

So always, when he heard the aircraft sound, he reached to Gabriel 
and transmitted memories of snow, keeping some for himself. 
Together they became cold; and when the planes were gone, they 
would shiver, holding each other, until sleep came again. 

Sometimes, urging the memories into Gabriel, Jonas felt that they 
were more shallow, a little weaker than they had been. It was what 
he had hoped, and what he and The Giver had planned: that as he 
moved away from the community, he would shed the memories and 
leave them behind for the people. But now, when he needed them, 
when the planes came, he tried hard to cling to what he still had, of 
cold, and to use it for their survival. 

Usually the aircraft came by day, when they were hiding. But he 
was alert at night, too, on the road, always listening intently for the 
sound of the engines. Even Gabriel listened, and would call out, 
"Plane! Plane!" sometimes before Jonas had heard the terrifying 
noise. When the aircraft searchers came, as they did occasionally, 
during the night as they rode, Jonas sped to the nearest tree or 
bush, dropped to the ground, and made himself and Gabriel cold. 
But it was sometimes a frighteningly close call. 

As he pedaled through the nights, through isolated landscape now, 
with the communities far behind and no sign of human habitation 
around him or ahead, he was 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 173 of 182 



170 



constantly vigilant, looking for the next nearest hiding place should 
the sound of engines come. 

But the frequency of the planes diminished. They came less often, 
and flew, when they did come, less slowly, as if the search had 
become haphazard and no longer hopeful. Finally there was an 
entire day and night when they did not come at all. 



171 



22 

Now the landscape was changing. It was a subtle change, hard to 
identify at first. The road was narrower, and bumpy, apparently no 
longer tended by road crews. It was harder, suddenly, to balance 
on the bike, as the front wheel wobbled over stones and ruts. 

One night Jonas fell, when the bike jolted to a sudden stop against 
a rock. He grabbed instinctively for Gabriel; and the newchild, 
strapped tightly in his seat, was uninjured, only frightened when the 
bike fell to its side. But Jonas's ankle was twisted, and his knees 
were scraped and raw, blood seeping through his torn trousers. 
Painfully he righted himself and the bike, and reassured Gabe. 

Tentatively he began to ride in daylight. He had forgotten the fear of 
the searchers, who seemed to have diminished into the past. But 
now there were new fears; the unfamiliar landscape held hidden, 
unknown perils. 

Trees became more numerous, and the forests beside the road 
were dark and thick with mystery. They saw streams more 
frequently now and stopped often to drink. Jonas carefully washed 
his injured knees, wincing as he rubbed at the raw flesh. The 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010

Page 174 of 182 



constant ache of his swollen ankle was eased when he soaked it 
occasionally in the cold water that rushed through roadside gullies. 



r 



172 



He was newly aware that Gabriel's safety depended entirely upon 
his own continued strength. 

They saw their first waterfall, and for the first time wildlife. 

"Plane! Plane!" Gabriel called, and Jonas turned swiftly into the 
trees, though he had not seen planes in days, and he did not hear 
an aircraft engine now. When he stopped the bicycle in the 
shrubbery and turned to grab Gabe, he saw the small chubby arm 
pointing toward the sky. 

Terrified, he looked up, but it was not a plane at all. Though he had 
never seen one before, he identified it from his fading memories, for 
The Giver had given them to him often. It was a bird. 

Soon there were many birds along the way, soaring overhead, 
calling. They saw deer; and once, beside the road, looking at them 
curious and unafraid, a small reddish-brown creature with a thick 
tail, whose name Jonas did not know. He slowed the bike and they 
stared at one another until the creature turned away and 
disappeared into the woods. 

All of it was new to him. After a life of Sameness and predictability, 
he was awed by the surprises that lay beyond each curve of the 
road. He slowed the bike again and again to look with wonder at 
wildflowers, to enjoy the throaty warble of a new bird nearby, or 
merely to watch the way wind shifted the leaves in the trees. During 
his twelve years in the community, he had never felt such simple 
moments of exquisite happiness.

10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 175 of 182 



But there were desperate fears building in him now as well. The 
most relentless of his new fears was that they would starve. Now 
that they had left the cultivated fields 



173 



behind them, it was almost impossible to find food. They finished 
the meager store of potatoes and carrots they had saved from the 
last agricultural area, and now they were always hungry. 

Jonas knelt by a stream and tried without success to catch a fish 
with his hands. Frustrated, he threw rocks into the water, knowing 
even as he did so that it was useless. Finally, in desperation, he 
fashioned a makeshift net, looping the strands of Gabriel's blanket 
around a curved stick. 

After countless tries, the net yielded two flopping silvery fish. 
Methodically Jonas hacked them to pieces with a sharp rock and 
fed the raw shreds to himself and to Gabriel. They ate some 
berries, and tried without success to catch a bird. 

At night, while Gabriel slept beside him, Jonas lay awake, tortured 
by hunger, and remembered his life in the community where meals 
were delivered to each dwelling every day. 

He tried to use the flagging power of his memory to recreate meals, 
and managed brief, tantalizing fragments: banquets with huge 
roasted meats; birthday parties with thick-frosted cakes; and lush 
fruits picked and eaten, sun-warmed and dripping, from trees. 

But when the memory glimpses subsided, he was left with the 
gnawing, painful emptiness. Jonas remembered, suddenly and 
grimly, the time in his childhood when he had been chastised for 
misusing a word. The word had been "starving." You have never 
been starving, he had been told. You will never be starving. 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 176 of 182 



Now he was. If he had stayed in the community, he 



174 



would not be. It was as simple as that. Once he had yearned for 
choice. Then, when he had had a choice, he had made the wrong 
one: the choice to leave. And now he was starving. 

But if he had stayed ... 

His thoughts continued. If he had stayed, he would have starved in 
other ways. He would have lived a life hungry for feelings, for color, 
for love. 

And Gabriel? For Gabriel there would have been no life at all. So 
there had not really been a choice. 

It became a struggle to ride the bicycle as Jonas weakened from 
lack of food, and realized at the same time that he was 
encountering something he had for a long time yearned to see: 
hills. His sprained ankle throbbed as he forced the pedal downward 
in an effort that was almost beyond him. 

And the weather was changing. It rained for two days. Jonas had 
never seen rain, though he had experienced it often in the 
memories. He had liked those rains, enjoyed the new feeling of it, 
but this was different. He and Gabriel became cold and wet, and it 
was hard to get dry, even when sunshine occasionally followed. 

Gabriel had not cried during the long frightening journey. Now he 
did. He cried because he was hungry and cold and terribly weak. 
Jonas cried, too, for the same reasons, and another reason as well. 
He wept because he was afraid now that he could not save Gabriel. 
He no longer cared about himself.

23 

Jonas felt more and more certain that the destination lay ahead of 
him, very near now in the night that was approaching. None of his 
senses confirmed it. He saw nothing ahead except the endless 
ribbon of road unfolding in twisting narrow curves. He heard no 
sound ahead. 

Yet he felt it: felt that Elsewhere was not far away. But he had little 
hope left that he would be able to reach it. His hope diminished 
further when the sharp, cold air began to blur and thicken with 
swirling white. 

Gabriel, wrapped in his inadequate blanket, was hunched, 
shivering, and silent in his little seat. Jonas stopped the bike 
wearily, lifted the child down, and realized with heartbreak how cold 
and weak Gabe had become. 

Standing in the freezing mound that was thickening around his 
numb feet, Jonas opened his own tunic, held Gabriel to his bare 
chest, and tied the torn and dirty blanket around them both. Gabriel 
moved feebly against him and whimpered briefly into the silence 
that surrounded them. 

Dimly, from a nearly forgotten perception as blurred as the 
substance itself, Jonas recalled what the whiteness was. 



176 



"It's called snow, Gabe," Jonas whispered. "Snowflakes. They fall 
down from the sky, and they're very beautiful." 

There was no response from the child who had once been so 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 178 of 182 



curious and alert. Jonas looked down through the dusk at the little 
head against his chest. Gabriel's curly hair was matted and filthy, 
and there were tearstains outlined in dirt on his pale cheeks. His 
eyes were closed. As Jonas watched, a snowflake drifted down and 
was caught briefly for a moment's sparkle in the tiny fluttering 
eyelashes. 

Wearily he remounted the bicycle. A steep hill loomed ahead. In the 
best of conditions, the hill would have been a difficult, demanding 
ride. But now the rapidly deepening snow obscured the narrow road 
and made the ride impossible. His front wheel moved forward 
imperceptibly as he pushed on the pedals with his numb, 
exhausted legs. But the bicycle stopped. It would not move. 

He got off and let it drop sideways into the snow. For a moment he 
thought how easy it would be to drop beside it himself, to let himself 
and Gabriel slide into the softness of snow, the darkness of night, 
the warm comfort of sleep. But he had come this far. He must try to 
go on. 

The memories had fallen behind him now, escaping from his 
protection to return to the people of his community. Were there any 
left at all? Could he hold onto a last bit of warmth? Did he still have 
the strength to Give? Could Gabriel still Receive? 

He pressed his hands into Gabriel's back and tried to remember 
sunshine. For a moment it seemed that nothing came to him, that 
his power was completely gone. Then 



177 



flickered suddenly, and he felt tiny tongues of heat begin to creep 
across and into his frozen feet and legs. He felt his face begin to 
glow and the tense, cold skin of his arms and hands relax. For a 
fleeting second he felt that he wanted to keep it for himself, to let 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 179 of 182 



himself bathe in sunlight, unburdened by anything or anyone else. 

But the moment passed and was followed by an urge, a need, a 
passionate yearning to share the warmth with the one person left 
for him to love. Aching from the effort, he forced the memory of 
warmth into the thin, shivering body in his arms. 

Gabriel stirred. For a moment they both were bathed in warmth and 
renewed strength as they stood hugging each other in the blinding 
snow. 

Jonas began to walk up the hill. 

The memory was agonizingly brief. He had trudged no more than a 
few yards through the night when it was gone and they were cold 
again. 

But his mind was alert now. Warming himself ever so briefly had 
shaken away the lethargy and resignation and restored his will to 
survive. He began to walk faster on feet that he could no longer 
feel. But the hill was treacherously steep; he was impeded by the 
snow and his own lack of strength. He didn't make it very far before 
he stumbled and fell forward. 

On his knees, unable to rise, Jonas tried a second time. His 
consciousness grasped at a wisp of another warm memory, and 
tried desperately to hold it there, to enlarge it, and pass it into 
Gabriel. His spirits and strength lifted with the momentary warmth 
and he stood. Again, Gabriel stirred against him as he began to 
climb. 



178 



But the memory faded, leaving him colder than before. If only he 
had had time to receive more warmth from The Giver before he 



file://C:\unzipped\The_Giver_Chelsea Poplow\The_Giver.xml 



10/19/2010 



The Giver 



Page 180 of 182 



escaped! Maybe there would be more left for him now. But there 
was no purpose in if-onlys. His entire concentration now had to be 
on moving his feet, warming Gabriel and himself, and going 
forward. 

He climbed, stopped, and warmed them both briefly again, with a 
tiny scrap of memory that seemed certainly to be all he had left. 

The top of the hill seemed so far away, and he did not know what 
lay beyond. But there was nothing left to do but continue. He 
trudged upward. 

As he approached the summit of the hill at last, something began to 
happen. He was not warmer; if anything, he felt more numb and 
more cold. He was not less exhausted; on the contrary, his steps 
were leaden, and he could barely move his freezing, tired legs. 

But he began, suddenly, to feel happy. He began to recall happy 
times. He remembered his parents and his sister. He remembered 
his friends, Asher and Fiona. He remembered The Giver. 

Memories of joy flooded through him suddenly. 

He reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the 
ground under his snow-covered feet become level. It would not be 
uphill anymore. 

"We're almost there, Gabriel," he whispered, feeling quite certain 
without knowing why. "I remember this place, Gabe." And it was 
true. But it was not a grasping of a thin and burdensome 
recollection; this was different. This was something that he could 
keep. It was a memory of his own.

He hugged Gabriel and rubbed him briskly, warming him, to keep 
him alive. The wind was bitterly cold. The snow swirled, blurring his 
vision. But somewhere ahead, through the blinding storm, he knew 
there was warmth and light. 

Using his final strength, and a special knowledge that was deep 
inside him, Jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the 
top of the hill. Numbly his hands fumbled for the rope. 

He settled himself on the sled and hugged Gabe close. The hill was 
steep but the snow was powdery and soft, and he knew that this 
time there would be no ice, no fall, no pain. Inside his freezing 
body, his heart surged with hope. 

They started down. 

Jonas felt himself losing consciousness and with his whole being 
willed himself to stay upright atop the sled, clutching Gabriel, 
keeping him safe. The runners sliced through the snow and the 
wind whipped at his face as they sped in a straight line through an 
incision that seemed to lead to the final destination, the place that 
he had always felt was waiting, the Elsewhere that held their future 
and their past. 

He forced his eyes open as they went downward, downward, 
sliding, and all at once he could see lights, and he recognized them 
now. He knew they were shining through the windows of rooms, 
that they were the red, blue, and yellow lights that twinkled from 
trees in places where families created and kept memories, where 
they celebrated love. 

Downward, downward, faster and faster. Suddenly he

was aware with certainty and joy that below, ahead, they were 
waiting for him; and that they were waiting, too, for the baby. For 
the first time, he heard something that he knew to be music. He 
heard people singing. 

Behind him, across vast distances of space and time, from the 
place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it
